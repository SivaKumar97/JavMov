1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm going to take a break.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm going to take a break.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm going to take a break.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm going to take a break.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to take a break.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm going to take a break.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm going to take a break.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm going to take a break.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm going to take a break.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm going to take a break.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey!

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Tetsuto!

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hey, Tetsuto!

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What are you doing? Were you sleeping?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Here.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is the watermelon I picked in my field.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Do you want to eat it?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No, I'm fine now.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm fine, so go to sleep.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I've been sleeping all day.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I was a little nervous, but I'm not nervous forever.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to sleep.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What are you doing here?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I haven't finished hunting yet.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's hot today, so I'm going to take a break.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But it's hot today.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Tetsuto, did you take a break again?

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No, I didn't.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Mom, you're my fan.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
When I was in Homamura the other day, I was very excited.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You're exaggerating.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I know you're not good at hunting.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You've been spending too much time at home.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Thank you.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
By the way, why is the air conditioner broken in this house?

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I can't sleep because it's hot.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't need an air conditioner.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's cool at night.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
After a long time, I came back to my hometown in the countryside where I was born and raised.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
My parents, who raised me in baseball, are proud of me as a professional baseball player.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
A few days ago, I was forcibly disposed of for a certain reason.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Sometimes I came back to my hometown to relax in the countryside.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hello.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hello.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is from Sayama-san.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Taro-san, this was caught in my field.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If you like, you can eat it.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thank you very much.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Thank you.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Tetsu-chan, you're back.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's been a long time.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hello.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hello.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is cucumber.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's fresh and delicious.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is bread.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Taro-san, you like soil.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's delicious.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm taking care of it.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's delicious.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thank you very much.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Thank you very much.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm proud to be on TV.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's good.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You are really good.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Thank you for always sending me off.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you buy my desk, it's okay, isn't it?

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Of course.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's okay.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm proud of you.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you, son.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Where is the sea grape?

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It wasn't there.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I ate it.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You ate it yesterday.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I ate it because I couldn't open it.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll buy it for you.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I see.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I have something to do with my mom tomorrow.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm going out.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is it tomorrow?

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I see.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It will take a while until the evening.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Please stay a little longer.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll be back in a year or so.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's okay.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll take this off.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Warm it up and eat it.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It was soft.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Thank you.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hello.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Taro?

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Taro, aren't you here?

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Did I wake you up?

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Where is Taro?

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He went out to go to the pharmacy.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I see.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How long will he be back?

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
About an hour.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He will be back in the evening.

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I see.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What should I do?

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll leave him here.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Tetsuto, did you have lunch?

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm waiting for you.

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll cook something.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Would you like to eat with me?

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's okay.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I haven't eaten yet.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay?

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay.

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
How is it? Is it good?

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes, it's very good.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Is that so? That's good.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I made it on my own. Is it okay?

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I think it's okay.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I made it on my own.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I see.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I see.

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
By the way, are you single?

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yes, I'm single.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I see.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But you're popular, aren't you?

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
No, I'm not.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I only play baseball, so I don't meet many people.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Is that so?

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I see.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Can I ask you something strange?

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's about the scoop, isn't it?

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No, it's not.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm curious about it.

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I've heard a lot about it on the Internet.

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Well...

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a fact, but...

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I've been tricked by someone.

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What do you mean?

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It was my fan.

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He came into contact with me.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He said,

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll keep it a secret.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Please make me a local wife.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was a strong man.

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I got drunk first.

147
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's how we got to know each other.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Right?

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Everyone is a sports player, isn't it?

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I often go to the countryside.

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's easy to get drunk.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But I can't get drunk once.

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I want to do it over and over again.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You have a strong desire to get drunk.

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I can't talk about this with anyone else.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I see.

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If I refuse to ask her out,

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll end up like this.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I see.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry I asked you a strange question.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's okay.

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I see.

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I envy you.

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What do you mean?

165
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You can't do it many times.

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I haven't been here for a long time.

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The countryside is nice.

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Is that so?

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
There's nothing here.

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The air is fresh.

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The stars are beautiful.

172
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I can't get drunk during the season.

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I see.

174
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I envy you.

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I envy you.

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I envy you.

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I envy you.

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I envy you.

179
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I envy you.

180
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I envy you.

181
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I envy you.

182
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I envy you.

183
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I envy you.

184
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I envy you.

185
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I envy you.

186
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I envy you.

187
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I envy you.

188
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I envy you.

189
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I envy you.

190
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What did you do?

191
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I didn't do anything.

192
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well...

193
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's your fault, isn't it?

194

You're married.

I want to do it once.

202
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
With a professional baseball player.

203
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Can't I do it?

204
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000

You have a lot of money.

What are you doing?

224
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Don't you like it?

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It hurts.

383
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It hurts.

384
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It hurts.

385
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It hurts.

386
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It hurts.

387
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It hurts.

388
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It hurts.

389
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It hurts.

390
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It hurts.

391
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It hurts.

392
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
What should I do?

393
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I can't stop.

394
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I can't stop.

395
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I can't stop.

396
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
It hurts.

397
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It hurts.

398
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It hurts.

399
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I can't stop.

400
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I can't stop.

401
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It hurts.

402
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It hurts.

403
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It hurts.

404
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It's hot.

405
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It hurts.

406
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It hurts.

407
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It hurts.

408
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It's hot.

409
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Did you feel better?

410
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I was moved.

411
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It's hot.

412
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You're sweating.

413
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You're sweating a lot.

415
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Would you like to take a bath together?

416
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Yes.

417
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
It's refreshing.

418
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It's refreshing.

419
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's refreshing.

420
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I can't move.

421
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I can't move.

422
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I can't move.

423
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It's a muscle.

424
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It's a muscle.

425
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Let's do it again.

426
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Let's do it again.

427
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Let's do it again.

428
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Let's do it again.

429
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's hot.

430
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It's hot.

431
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It's hot.

432
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It's hot today.

433
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I'm going to the field.

434
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
If you're hungry, you can eat in the refrigerator.

435
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Okay.

436
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It's hot.

437
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's hot.

438
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I fell in love with Sayama's body.

439
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I fell in love with Sayama's body.

440
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I fell in love with Sayama's body.

441
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Sayama has come to see me like someone who had a fan.

442
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Sayama has come to see me like someone who had a fan.

443
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Sayama was looking for me on a day when my father wasn't home.

444
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I couldn't deny the invitation.

445
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
This cucumber is really good with Ai-chan.

446
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Really?

447
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
What is it?

448
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It's different.

449
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
What is it?

450
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I'm sure you're good at putting it on.

451
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Ai-chan, are you putting it on?

452
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You put it on for me, didn't you?

453
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
No, no.

454
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
What is it?

455
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I don't know how to do it.

456
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Sorry, sorry.

457
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You're good at drinking, aren't you?

458
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
You're right.

459
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's cold, isn't it?

460
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Ai-chan, are you going to be okay at this time?

461
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm fine.

462
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
My husband is already sleeping.

463
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Is that so?

464
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm close to him, so I'm fine.

465
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Ai-chan, what if I stay at home?

466
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
What?

467
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Are you sure?

468
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm fine.

469
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
It's already this time.

470
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
It's already this time.

471
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Ai-chan, put the futon in the back room.

472
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Okay?

473
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Let's drink.

474
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Let's drink a lot.

475
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Cheers!

476
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Ai-chan!

477
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Ai-chan!

478
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Ai-chan, you're good at drinking.

479
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
What is it today?

480
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
It's delicious.

481
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Really?

482
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It's been a long time since it was so lively.

483
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It's different from Ai-chan.

484
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
That's right.

485
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It's been a long time.

486
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I have to go out at 5 o'clock.

487
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's early.

488
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
That's right.

489
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I want you to do your best alone tomorrow.

490
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Ai-chan, you can sleep here.

491
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
It's better to leave it alone.

492
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It's better to leave it alone.

493
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's better to leave it alone.

494
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Let me help you.

495
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I'm sorry to ask you to prepare the futon alone.

496
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
That's not true.

497
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It's okay.

499
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
You're a good girl.

500
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Hush.

501
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Masa, are you drunk?

502
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
What?

503
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Your parents are over there.

504
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
It's okay.

505
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I have to speak up.

506
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It's okay.

507
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Miki-chan.

508
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
You woke up.

509
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

510
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It's okay.

511
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I'll be quiet.

512
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
No.

513
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I didn't do it today.

514
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
You didn't do it?

515
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
No.

516
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
You didn't do it?

517
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Look at this.

518
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It's full of iron.

519
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I don't like it.

520
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
You don't like it, do you?

521
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I didn't do it.

522
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It's a little rusty.

523
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I have to be careful not to be found out.

524
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
What are you doing?

525
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It's a baby.

526
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It's a baby.

527
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I thought it was a baby.

528
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I thought so, too.

529
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I thought it was a baby.

530
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's not a baby.

531
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I thought so, too.

532
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
What's wrong?

533
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It's a baby.

534
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
But you're sleeping.

535
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I'm so excited.

536
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Don't speak up.

537
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I'll be quiet.

538
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
It's a baby.

539
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It's gone.

540
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
It's a baby.

541
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
It's a baby.

542
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I'll be quiet.

543
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It's a baby.

544
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's a baby.

545
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It's a baby.

546
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
It's a baby.

547
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Do it.

548
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It's a baby.

549
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,020
Yeah.

550
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,060
Just once...

551
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It's hot, hot, hot.

552
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
It's hot, hot, hot.

553
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It's hot, hot.

554
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It's hot, hot, hot.

555
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
It's hot, hot, hot.

556
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
It's hot, hot, hot.

557
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
It's hot, hot, hot.

558
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It's hot, hot, hot.

559
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
It's hot, hot, hot.

560
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Where did Tetsu go?

561
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
He was in the futon.

562
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
He should be back by now.

563
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
What about Ai-chan?

564
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
She was in the futon, too.

565
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I think Tetsu is out for a walk.

566
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Did he go for a walk?

567
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Did he go for a walk?

568
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Tetsu is out for a walk.

569
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000

It's okay.

583
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
It's okay.

584
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
It's okay.

585
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Is that so?

586
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
That's amazing.

587
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Shizuka, do you want some water?

588
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It's too hot.

589
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Shizuka, do you want some water?

590
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Shizuka, is it hard to do?

591
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I see.

592
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I see.

593
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000

594
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I didn't know.

595
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I didn't know.

596
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000

I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing

608
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,040
but I think it's a good thing

609
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,240
I think it's a good thing

610
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,680
I think it's a good thing

611
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,960
I think it's a good thing

612
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,160
I think it's a good thing

613
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,360
I think it's a good thing

614
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,560
I think it's a good thing

615
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,840
I think it's a good thing

616
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,880
I think it's a good thing

617
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,080
I think it's a good thing

618
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,280
I think it's a good thing

619
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,480
I think it's a good thing

620
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,600
I think it's a good thing

621
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,800
I think it's a good thing

622
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,000
I think it's a good thing

623
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,200
I think it's a good thing

624
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,400
I think it's a good thing

625
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,680

01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,000
I think it's a good thing

628
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,200
I think it's a good thing

629
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,120
I think it's a good thing

01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,400
I think it's a good thing

631
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,760
I think it's a good thing

632
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,600
I think it's a good thing

633
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,080
I'm not sure if it's a good thing

634
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,080
because the last time I found

635
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,760
in a far way

636
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,100
I think it's a good thing

637
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,200
It's a good thing

638
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,280
and it's the best thing

639
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,560
I've found so far

640
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,080
and it's the best thing

641
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,080
It's hot.

642
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,080
It's perfect.

643
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,080
It's hot.

644
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,080
It's hot.

645
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,080
It's too hot.

It's hot.

660
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,080
It's hot.

661
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,080
It's hot.

662
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,080
It's hot.

663
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,080
It's hot.

664
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,080
It's hot.

665
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,080
I love this.

666
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,080
I'm sorry.

667
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,080
I couldn't stand it.

668
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,080
It's hot.

669
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,080
It's hot.

670
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,080
It's hot.

671
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,080
It's hot.

It's hot.

676
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,080
It's hot.

677
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,080
I'll go to the field again.

678
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,080
Okay.

679
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,080
I didn't see you there.

680
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,080
Well.

681
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,080
You're right.

682
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,080
You were sleeping, weren't you?

683
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,080
Yes.

684
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,080
You were weak.

685
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,080
Yes.

686
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,080
Did I make your bed?

687
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,080
Yes, of course.

688
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,080
Are you still sleeping?

689
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,080
I think so.

690
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,080
Really?

691
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,080
You'll go home when you wake up.

692
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,080
Your house is close.

693
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,080
I'll go to the field.

694
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,080
Okay.

695
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,080
Be careful.

696
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,080
Okay.

697
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,080
It's hot.

698
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,080
It's hot.

699
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,080
What are you doing?

700
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,080
What?

701
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,080
Did you wake up?

702
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,080
I'm glad you woke up.

703
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,080
No.

704
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,080
What are you doing in the morning?

705
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,080
Wait a minute.

706
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,080
I'm afraid you'll wake up.

707
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,080
Don't worry.

708
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,080
We didn't go to the field.

709
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,080
Okay.

710
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,080
If you sleep like this, you can't stand it.

711
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,080
If you sleep like this, you can't stand it.

712
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,080
It's hot.

713
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,080
It's hard.

714
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,080
It's hard.

715
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,080
It's hard.

716
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,080
It tickles.

717
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,080
It tickles.

718
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,080
It tickles.

719
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,080
Can I lick you?

720
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,080
Can I lick you?

721
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,080
I'll make you feel better.

722
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,080
It's hot.

723
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,080
It's hot.

724
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,080

It's hot.

726
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,080
It's hot.

727
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,080
It's hot.

728

It's hot.

730
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,080
It tickles.

731
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,080
It tickles.

732
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,080
It tickles.

733
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,080
It tickles.

734
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,080
I'll play with you with my boobs.

735
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,080
Come here.

736
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,080
Oh, my God.

737
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,080
Oh, my God.

738
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,080
Does it feel good?

739
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,080
Oh, my God.

740
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,080
Oh, my God. It's slippery.

741
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,080
My boobs are sticky.

742
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,080
Oh, my God.

743
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,080
I can't take it anymore.

744
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,080
I want to do it.

745
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,080
Put it in.

746
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,080
I want you to show me your boobs.

747
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,080
A little more.

748
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,080
A little more?

749
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,080
I have no choice.

750
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,080
Do your boobs feel so good?

751
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,080
Oh, my God.

752
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,080
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

755
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,080
Do you want me to do it?

756
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,080
Oh, my God.

757
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,080
Oh, my God.

758

Oh, my God.

761
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,080
Oh, my God.

762
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,080
Did you feel good?

763
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,080
Oh, my God.

764
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,080
Oh, my God.

765
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,080
But I have to go home soon.

766
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,080
Before that...

767
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,080
Let's do it one more time.

768
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,080
Okay.

769
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,080

Oh, my God.

810
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:40,580
It was a hot summer night.

811
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:47,580
The fireworks were beautiful, weren't they?

812
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,580
Yes, they were.

813
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:52,580
Summer festivals are great.

814
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:54,580
Yes.

815
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:58,580
But was it okay to leave your husband behind?

816
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:00,580
Yes, it was.

817
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:04,580
He drinks until late every year.

818
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:06,580
I see.

819
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:12,580
Well, my parents seemed to enjoy it, so it's okay.

820
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:25,580
But you're leaving tomorrow, aren't you?

821
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,580
Yes, I am.

822
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:35,580
I'm going to miss you.

Yes.

824
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,580
I want to do it again.

825
01:25:55,580 --> 01:26:00,580
But my parents will be back soon.

826
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:05,580
But it's the last night.

827
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,580
The fireworks are over.

828
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:08,580
Yes.

829
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,580
What are you going to do?

830
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:11,580
Nothing.

831
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:12,580
Okay?

832
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:13,580
No.

833
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:14,580
What are you going to do?

834
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:16,580
The last thing.

835
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:19,580
Yes, the last memory.

836
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:20,580
Okay?

1054
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:33,560
It's disgusting.

1055
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:49,560
It feels so good.

1056
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:51,560

It's still wet.

1080
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:33,560
I can't sleep.

1081
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:35,560
I can't sleep.

1082
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:55,560
I'm tired.

1083
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:57,560
I'm tired.

1084
01:51:57,560 --> 01:51:59,560
Give me a little more.

1085
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:35,560
I made the best memory.

1086
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,560

01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:57,560
If I'm not chosen as a representative, I'll do my best.

01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:59,560
Let's go.

1096

How are you?

Don't worry about me.

See you.

1100
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:21,560
It's been a long time since I came back to my hometown.

1101
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:28,560
I was mentally depressed after being discharged from prison.

1102
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:33,560
I feel like I've been encouraged in many ways.

1103
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:41,560
I don't have a game center or a convenience store.

1104
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:51,560
I'm really grateful to Ai.

1105
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:21,560
Thank you for watching.

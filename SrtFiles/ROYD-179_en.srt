1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,190
Yes to.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,370
Is Mr. Kato happy?

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,500
Oh, oh, oh, how about it.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,820
Iris, come back when you’re done.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,560
No, I don’t want to go.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,040
Why is it.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,900
Come and find tea.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,901
No, I don’t want to go, this.

10
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:33,120
No, say this

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,700
No, what to do.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,081
No, I don’t want to go.

13
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:42,721
No, why is it.

14
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:43,561
Say to me.

15
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:45,620
Go to

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,100
I go to

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,781
Nothing is anything.

18
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:51,860
Go to?

19
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,790
The River

20
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,111
The previous documents.

21
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:03,750
Named by

22
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,981
Why not.

23
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:07,481
and again.

24
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,960
Thanks to.

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,520
Not that you.

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,860
Please take a little.

27
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,360
Do it.

28
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,040
Close your eyes in 10 minutes.

29
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,820
OK is?

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,240
Have you lost?

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,660
Can I send you email again?

32
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,300
Please be kind.

33
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,960
Take it right away, you.

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,580
You are the troubled.

35
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,760
Take it, close your eyes now.

36
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,800
In five minutes, in five minutes.

37
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,300
Yes yes yes.

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,921
Because I just sold it.

39
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:36,420
Very much lying.

40
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,221
Mr. Sato, I was getting a gift.

41
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:41,640
Yes, it is over already.

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,760
well is.

43
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,781
Thanks to Mr. Sato.

44
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:48,420
Not like any other actor.

45
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,401
Thanks, so keep going.

46
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:52,901
Yes, I understand

47
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,661
Mr. Sato can work.

48
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:59,580
No is so.

49
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,641
The fourth year?

50
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:02,500
Oh yes is.

51
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,621
Really good sales qualifications.

52
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:06,121
Oh it is true.

53
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,600
But the water has not lost.

54
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,100
Thanks to.

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,520
compared to that,

56
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,620
It is Togo, Togo.

57
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,120
Are you here? – Togo

58
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,321
Email cannot be opened.

59
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:20,120
You can’t open the email.

60
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,140
A half-month sales report

61
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,660
You know it?

62
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,420
I have not taken it, this is the number.

63
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,960
No, a little by chance.

64
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,900
It is coincidence.

65
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,700
It did not work.

66
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,560
Did I sleep in the car?

67
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,341
Look at them, they are both.

68
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:39,900
Did you open the email, not the email?

69
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,060
You opened the email.

70
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,300
No, it opened up.

71
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,400
Oh, you opened it up?

72
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,460
No, I am crazy.

73
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,320
It is here.

74
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,580
Oh here from here?

75
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,280
It was open.

76
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,240
Go to bed.

77
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,140
Yes I understand.

78
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,700
really is.

79
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,960
If it were, if it was me.

80
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,041
I told you not to come at this time.

81
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,640
Will come home this week.

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,221
Your mother is worried.

83
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:15,841
I said I am busy.

84
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:18,480
Are you busy.

85
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,641
Your mother is worried.

86
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:22,141
Come back home.

87
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,821
Try to go home next month.

88
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:26,321
The next month?

89
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,401
No to

90
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:31,801
My dad got a little bad.

91
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:34,440
Are you going home this week?

92
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,080
Is it so?

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,580
Is it okay?

94
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,000
It is hard.

95
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,320
I am fine.

96
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,460
You are okay or you are alone.

97
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,260
What are you doing?

98
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,620
No one to go home.

99
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,101
Good enough.

100
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,240
You are 25.

101
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,400
How many times do you say that?

102
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,840
Not because it is no longer decided.

103
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,180
You have to buy a house, have a family, or anything.

104
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,140
I am married too.

105
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,000
Why Why?

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,880
Is it so?

107
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,400
Take her here.

108
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,150
Yes, bring it with you.

109
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,890
So take it here.

110
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,890
Okay, I’ll prepare it here.

111
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,890
I understand.

112
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,910
This week.

113
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,211
Enjoy it.

114
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,711
Yes

115
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,211
I am waiting for you this week.

116
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:44,331
Because they do work too.

117
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:45,171
Then is.

118
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:47,350
Go here and go around the store.

119
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,590
Then is.

120
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,251
Good to you.

121
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,890
Good to you.

122
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,111
Not a little reassured.

123
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:57,210
But what kind of person.

124
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,670
Will Sato get married?

125
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:10,050
No, I have a little parents, get married, get married, because it’s noisy.

126
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,410
You said it with strength.

127
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,031
So it is not that.

128
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:16,531
Absolutely different.

129
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,670
You are not there.

130
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,810
Because I only do work.

131
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,231
What is the water? what is the water?

132
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:26,530
No, no, I am sorry

133
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,451
Were you interested?

134
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:28,751
No, not so is it.

135
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:28,991
That is.

136
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:31,090
No, it is a little bit.

137
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,391
not the.

138
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:32,251
Congratulations to you.

139
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:35,570
I don’t like to go ahead.

140
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,250
A little fun.

141
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,710
So, wait this week, if you want to come home with me?

142
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:51,090
It is not to say that no one will take you.

143
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,030
Yes, yes, no, I am sorry, yes, I am okay.

144
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,630
I can do something. thanks.

145
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,690
Then then.

146
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,120
Tired of.

147
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,620
Good morning sir.

148
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,510
I think Mr. Sato is going to get married.

149
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,650
Did you not listen?

150
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:30,790
Well, I’ll say, I’ll call your dad soon.

151
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,690
Oh yeah yes.

152
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,630
Get married, get married, and make a noise.

153
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,251
I told him I was going to get married a little bit.

154
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:42,010
Oh, and do you do?

155
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,650
Yes, I will not.

156
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,570
Oh, I do not do.

157
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,511
But something, something

158
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:55,690
I’ll go to my wedding this weekend and tell my parents.

159
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,990
What do you do?

160
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,390
I called a friend, I tried.

161
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,430
Everyone said they can’t.

162
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:17,190
I have a matching app or something, and if someone takes it, what if they are in there?

163
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:24,270
No, I don’t think the people I met on the app might meet their parents.

164
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,050
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

165
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,810
So, bring something nice.

166
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,730
If it really does like marriage, I don’t want it.

167
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:40,290
There are a lot of hippies around us.

168
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,790
The high spec?

169
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,430
There is no good guy that your parents don’t like.

170
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:57,260
No man, no man, no man, no man, no man, no man, no man, no man, no man.

171
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,330
So, Mr. Todd, what’s going on this week?

172
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,710
I have a little request.

173
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,460
I am with you, Mr. Tohoku.

174
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,960
Thanks, I am pleased.

175
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,441
It is called Tōgoku Suarez.

176
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:26,441
Welcome to.

177
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:28,720
Sorry for the late greeting.

178
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,821
This is boring though.

179
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:35,040
If you like, I am sorry.

180
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,480
thank you.

181
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,040
Oh my dear, thank you.

182
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,720
and afterwards.

183
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,860
Let’s eat later.

184
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,520
It was far away, right?

185
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,180
No, yes yes yes

186
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,480
Are they both in the same department?

187
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,660
Yes yes yes.

188
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,780
The same colleague.

189
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,280
Yes to.

190
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,760
And face to face for a long time.

191
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,981
well is.

192
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:03,080
Yes, the desk is next to it.

193
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,921
It is now.

194
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,500
Is the desk next door?

195
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,500
Do you know the workplace?

196
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,021
No, I have not talked yet.

197
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,260
Yes, I am not talking.

198
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,740
So to say,

199
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,560
I don’t know what Tucson likes.

200
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,920
I made your favorite cup today.

201
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,100
You like your mother’s food, right?

202
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,600
really is?

203
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,600
Can you still eat?

204
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,960
Is it okay?

205
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,360
Do you not like it?

206
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,980
not is

207
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,301
I will prepare.

208
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:44,721
In the meantime, relax a little.

209
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:45,841
You can sit.

210
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:47,461
Sorry to

211
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,281
to mother.

212
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:54,600
Spice, what university is it?

213
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,100
How about?

214
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,281
I am anyway.

215
00:09:57,281 --> 00:09:58,980
It is already cold.

216
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,400
I said, I said.

217
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,120
Oh my old man.

218
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,540
Oh really?

219
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,200
Drink and drink and drink.

220
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,621
Sorry, I’m going to go first.

221
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:13,200
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

222
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
What is.

223
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,720
Oh no no no.

224
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,740
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

225
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,020
Oh thank you.

226
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,400
Please let me catch you.

227
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,720
My daughter’s wife is okay, so I’m okay.

228
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,880
is there.

229
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,020
Is it your wife? – No.

230
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,340
Enjoy it today.

231
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,041
After hearing me.

232
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,200
And then toast.

233
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,220
Is the mountain still alive?

234
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,721
No, I have never met you.

235
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:42,840
Oh yeah, so is it.

236
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,200
What happens when students go to the store often?

237
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,800
It was before the station of Machu Picchu.

238
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,021
Is it a coffee shop?

239
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,580
The thousand land?

240
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,600
Maybe it was a coffee shop.

241
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,421
Oh, and so on.

242
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:02,540
I used this coffee shop very often.

243
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,240
You met often, right?

244
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,041
Is it yes?

245
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,880
Well, I know you, because you know me at college.

246
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,641
It is yes.

247
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:12,141
Are you in touch?

248
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,300
A good boy has come.

249
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,980
We are talking, right?

250
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,740
So, is it from there?

251
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,041
No, it is from a completely different place.

252
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,860
Where are you from?

253
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,901
I am Nagano.

254
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:30,660
Oh and Nagano?

255
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,221
Yes Yes Yes

256
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:32,380
I am also Nagano.

257
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,441
Oh, was it so?

258
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:34,900
Which city is it?

259
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,481
I am Matsumoto.

260
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:38,520
Is it Matsumoto?

261
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,720
Are you no longer old?

262
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,201
Oh, that is something.

263
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:46,241
Born in Matsumoto.

264
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:47,521
Growing up, and that.

265
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:49,420
Born by Matsumoto.

266
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,401
by Nagoya

267
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:52,541
Oh yeah yeah yeah

268
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,180
You do not know, you.

269
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,580
Oh, I didn’t say.

270
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,641
But I was wrong with other people.

271
00:11:58,641 --> 00:12:00,320
Oh, and so on.

272
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,760
Oh well well well.

273
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,281
Well, but there are also such things.

274
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:05,201
Okay, you are well.

275
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:07,560
It comes from Matsuda.

276
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,421
Not close to your grandmother’s house.

277
00:12:11,421 --> 00:12:12,681
Oh yeah yeah.

278
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:14,681
Very close to.

279
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:17,380
Do not forget.

280
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,080
Not great.

281
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,600
Tastefully

282
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,300
Is it okay? is there nothing to cut?

283
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,061
It really tastes.

284
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,200
This is, here is

285
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,940
Is this delicious?

286
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,980
Sorry to

287
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,680
and salt.

288
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,661
Always very much.

289
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:41,141
No, but well

290
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:44,400
We haven’t talked about the con yet.

291
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,161
Why did you not talk?

292
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:52,741
I said that I’m going to get married, but that’s just what it might be.

293
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:57,001
No matter what, both are now.

294
00:12:57,001 --> 00:13:02,500
What about it? – I was presented for free.

295
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,500
How about Todd, are you going to get married?

296
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,760
There is

297
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,121
Oh well was.

298
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,060
Yes is it.

299
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,800
Is there a name for your father?

300
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,620
Have you already decided on the venue?

301
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,521
It is not determined.

302
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:24,880
For example, there is a good place for a church or a good association.

303
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,500
What place do you like?

304
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,681
Both seem to fit well.

305
00:13:30,681 --> 00:13:32,060
Oh yeah yeah

306
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,280
Would you give me a sacred place?

307
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,181
The tombs are fine.

308
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:42,321
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

309
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,820
What are you happy with?

310
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,120
How many kids do you think about?

311
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,880
The child?

312
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,740
About how many?

313
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,980
Or six people?

314
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,900
Six people?

315
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,120
6 is!

316
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,421
Ballet and ballet usually make a team.

317
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,220
Oh well well!

318
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,520
Is it one?

319
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,180
Not all parents have a team, right?

320
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,021
No, it might be that too.

321
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:07,881
Okay, it is fun.

322
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:12,840
If you want to change it, you can make it to two families.

323
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,080
Oh well okay.

324
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,860
Decide about something.

325
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,081
If you get married, you also need a home.

326
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:20,220
Yes, I hope it happens.

327
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,200
It has expanded.

328
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,400
Okay is it?

329
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,480
Absolutely OK.

330
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,180
I still want to do my job and I just got a big job.

331
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,760
If you are a child, you have to be a worker yourself.

332
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,680
Yes is it.

333
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:40,160
This is a little bit of a shame, so you need to protect your home.

334
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,840
Oh well, yes is it.

335
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,400
See also!

336
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,780
That big job should be done by separating it?

337
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,240
You should start working early and take care of your family.

338
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,700
Only family can feel like that.

339
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,000
But it is already 25.

340
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,300
When you get married, you have to think about your family first.

341
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,080
Yes, here is the third grandson, Suzuka, now the second grandson.

342
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,701
Yes is.

343
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:13,581
Yes, in this area.

344
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:15,741
It’s too early, but here.

345
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:17,300
Well yes yes.

346
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,700
The house is home, shit.

347
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,080
Marrying is home, so leave it.

348
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,240
Well, well, but it’s time to get married.

349
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,740
Timing and timing.

350
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,320
It is a big wave, you have to go when there is history.

351
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,360
No to no.

352
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,540
I met a good guy.

353
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,740
No to yes.

354
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,320
Why not talk to yourself.

355
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,640
Talk about it like that,

356
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,360
It is me who will be hard later.

357
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,320
You should talk now.

358
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,661
Because the river is no longer relevant.

359
00:15:57,661 --> 00:16:00,840
I will be told afterwards.

360
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,160
It tastes good, this.

361
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,160
It tastes good.

362
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,781
Drinks around here.

363
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:12,281
Yes is what.

364
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,400
The most pressed.

365
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,160
Drink a little.

366
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,380
If you drink it, it will be expensive.

367
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,560
I dream of drinking safely.

368
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,420
No, please let me catch.

369
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,120
Not extending too much.

370
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,440
Okay, okay is okay.

371
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,080
If you can’t go home anyway.

372
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,560
You do not need to go home.

373
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,960
What are you saying?

374
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,720
You do not need to go home.

375
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,360
Sorry to.

376
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
I should stay here.

377
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,060
No, it is not good.

378
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,560
Why is it?

379
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,180
It is delicious.

380
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,700
Tomorrow is too early, right?

381
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,121
Oh to?

382
00:16:54,121 --> 00:17:01,040
I’m not saying you’re going to go up the mountain tomorrow, right?

383
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,220
No, I won’t go tomorrow.

384
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,740
It will rain tomorrow.

385
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,380
Is it okay?

386
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,060
No, I am not going tomorrow.

387
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,880
How to climb?

388
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,941
It was the mountain department.

389
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:16,320
Oh, oh, oh, yes really is it.

390
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,760
Yes, yes is yes.

391
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,820
Exciting to climb together.

392
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,621
Oh well okay.

393
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:24,360
Let’s go with you on a clear day.

394
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,000
Okay is.

395
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,840
Do not connect the station.

396
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,260
Why not? well okay.

397
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,960
Go out and change clothes, right?

398
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,361
Oh well.

399
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:35,740
I think so too.

400
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,661
Oh well.

401
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:38,380
This is really delicious.

402
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,421
Sleeping is easy, this.

403
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:42,660
But so much, okay?

404
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,080
Sleep to sleep.

405
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,101
Sleeping together and together.

406
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:46,641
Now, but go home sooner.

407
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:48,200
Oh well Mr. Kowalski.

408
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,020
You’re going to stay here today, right?

409
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,221
Oh well okay?

410
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:54,320
Okay, it is absolutely okay!

411
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,620
No, it is anything!

412
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,401
It is OK!

413
00:17:56,401 --> 00:18:00,280
My daddy’s pyjamas are new.

414
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,241
Sorry about something...

415
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:03,261
Be slowly!

416
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:04,560
It is OK!

417
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,060
Oh yeah!

418
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,700
Oh, and your dad, right?

419
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,520
But isn’t it too upset for the river?

420
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,081
It was the first day and...

421
00:18:15,081 --> 00:18:17,821
No, I am absolutely...

422
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:20,561
I have always thought of salt.

423
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:22,541
Why about the Kashmir...

424
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,080
Did you call at the time?

425
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:32,040
I haven’t told you about dating a company yet.

426
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,560
Usually in the company.

427
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,860
Oh well well well.

428
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,360
Yes is.

429
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,900
It is different at home.

430
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,900
It is different at home.

431
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,760
How is it called?

432
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,360
See also Couture.

433
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,601
Mr Cottage is.

434
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:51,660
here here?

435
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,160
Which of them?

436
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,160
Both are.

437
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,081
It changes by day.

438
00:18:58,081 --> 00:18:59,201
Yes to Yes.

439
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:00,641
You read it under the name below.

440
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:01,721
Yes is yes.

441
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:06,920
Stop and stop.

442
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,200
Then it is decided.

443
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,641
Good thing, Dad.

444
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:13,060
So I have to arrange it.

445
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,261
Drink and I will go.

446
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:16,900
I will eat.

447
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,750
Then

448
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,551
Give her a pyjama.

449
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:24,630
Going to the bath?

450
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,011
Yes, so I’ll prepare a bath.

451
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:30,631
Do it, do it.

452
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:32,490
So go in both of us?

453
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,010
No, they are not good at both.

454
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,290
It’s not a very small bathroom, so we’re both.

455
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,131
No, we are both, a little.

456
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:43,550
Because the next?

457
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,510
I am dating.

458
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,130
Because you still have your mom and dad in there.

459
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,031
You will go in together, right?

460
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:54,970
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes!

461
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,290
So I’ll come to use the bath.

462
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,641
is delicious?

463
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:08,141
It is delicious, right?

464
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,860
Something or something.

465
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,061
I really love you, hi.

466
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:18,600
I will be a good girl, this.

467
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,021
So, I’m going to talk a lot about it.

468
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:26,040
I don’t want to take a bath with you.

469
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,741
No, if it was going to flow, it would have been like that.

470
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:38,441
When I answered yes, I didn’t think it would happen, so I couldn’t work.

471
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:42,900
No, no, there is no atmosphere.

472
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,181
No to no.

473
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:47,680
Yes is

474
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,180
What is

475
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,060
Today, I love the bathroom.

476
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,180
Because he is no longer a child.

477
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,220
Yes thank you.

478
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,720
Have you seen?

479
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,440
Yes I saw.

480
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,900
Oh, it is awesome.

481
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:12,280
Great, where you are going.

482
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,060
Are you in?

483
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,260
Come in, go in there.

484
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,580
Which of them?

485
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,620
Wait behind you.

486
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,120
Together and together.

487
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,220
You have to look through the mirror.

488
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,400
Oh, I haven’t seen it anymore.

489
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,720
No to, how about?

490
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,960
Not yet in.

491
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,960
It will cool.

492
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,960
Wait a little.

493
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,011
You have seen it.

494
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:50,470
I have not seen.

495
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,320
Is there anything?

496
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,561
No, do not touch it.

497
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:58,141
I did not touch.

498
00:21:58,141 --> 00:22:01,681
I have to go in this too.

499
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:03,801
Yes, there is no other way.

500
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:24,390
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, no

501
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,331
Oh no, no, I thought I would tell you where to put it.

502
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:30,070
On the washing machine.

503
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,821
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

504
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:37,760
Okay, okay, I have taken it off somewhat.

505
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,060
Should I take off my pants?

506
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,240
Okay, yes is it.

507
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,580
Do not look.

508
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,860
No, look at it, don’t look at it.

509
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,580
I didn’t see it, I didn’t see it. – Now it’s not.

510
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,320
What is?

511
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,080
Oh a little.

512
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,260
Oh no no no.

513
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,680
What are you guessing?

514
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,260
I do not guess.

515
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,860
What to do?

516
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,620
Let us enter.

517
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,560
Yes, yes, you can go in.

518
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,221
meet for a long time.

519
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:45,820
I like these things.

520
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,760
It feels good.

521
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,430
is

522
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,330
by the way.

523
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,130
Why not return it.

524
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,341
I was there when I entered.

525
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:20,501
Oh, it was so.

526
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:24,520
It was too much priority for work.

527
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,870
You are definitely working hard.

528
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,790
Is there no such place?

529
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,290
No, there is no.

530
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,120
There is not, but.

531
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,790
something like this.

532
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,120
No, no, no otherwise is okay.

533
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,500
Do not make a boyfriend?

534
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:05,650
Do you feel like your job is a lover now?

535
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,231
I feel something bad.

536
00:25:11,231 --> 00:25:12,731
really is?

537
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,411
I don’t have any wishes that I would marry in the future.

538
00:25:17,411 --> 00:25:20,151
I think I’ll be single all my life.

539
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:29,420
Oh, otherwise

540
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,000
Can your boyfriend be working together?

541
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,501
by Mr Sato.

542
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:39,780
Oh, it is not that kind of equipment.

543
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,281
I did not look like that.

544
00:25:42,281 --> 00:25:46,420
You can’t focus on just one thing.

545
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,860
I cannot even do one thing.

546
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,960
Yes is.

547
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,200
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

548
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,600
That is the river, right?

549
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,750
What are you watching?

550
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:21,461
Oh yeah no no.

551
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:23,020
Mr. Kashmir

552
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,940
I put my pyjamas.

553
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,180
Thanks to.

554
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,490
Wash your body.

555
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:59,130
I washed, washed, washed, and washed as usual.

556
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,630
As always, yes

557
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,150
Yes, so do it.

558
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,410
It feels good.

559
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,110
No, because I do it every day.

560
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,050
The other is.

561
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:29,930
Great that thing.

562
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:36,330
Shia, you think your breasts are bigger?

563
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,290
What is it going well?

564
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,930
Where are you touching?

565
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,510
What are you touching?

566
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,610
Great, it is there.

567
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,330
Do not touch here.

568
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:51,450
Do not think you have grown up.

569
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:12,080
It has grown.

570
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,900
What happened? is it okay?

571
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,260
Okay, it is warm.

572
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,650
I am not okay.

573
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:45,581
Why? he did nothing.

574
00:28:45,581 --> 00:28:47,820
You can know.

575
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,490
What do you smell?

576
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,320
by nearby

577
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:11,151
Do not shake a little.

578
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:12,651
to shake?

579
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,120
Because I am just washing.

580
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,520
A little bit.

581
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,700
Sorry sorry sorry

582
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,441
A little

583
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:40,711
Sorry to sorry.

584
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:43,750
You did not hit.

585
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:10,300
When did it disappear?

586
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,580
But, maybe, but maybe

587
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,021
Actually, listen to it right away.

588
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:18,901
by

589
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,000
A possible type.

590
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,801
It seems possible, right?

591
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:26,020
Possibly he will come back soon.

592
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,590
and so on.

593
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:38,210
Wash it as usual.

594
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,070
Please please

595
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,181
Please today.

596
00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:57,780
with today.

597
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,310
Feels good.

598
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,550
must be quick.

599
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,620
Feel good

600
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,890
slowly

601
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,891
Follow it by way.

602
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:38,030
Thanks to Shia.

603
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,430
Yes, I like that feeling.

604
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,690
I don’t know what my dad likes.

605
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,850
Oh yes yes.

606
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,810
I want the cakes to wash well too.

607
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,050
What here?

608
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,780
It feels good.

609
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,820
It feels good.

610
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,380
A little bit,

611
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,331
Be quick.

612
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:20,570
Yes Yes Yes

613
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,380
Not well there.

614
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,720
No is

615
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,940
I do not know.

616
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,921
Look at it a little.

617
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:35,081
No to

618
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:36,321
Do not think you are.

619
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,901
I think there.

620
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:39,760
What do you know.

621
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,640
No, you know.

622
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,761
I know your father’s feelings.

623
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,800
Definitely there.

624
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,760
Because there is definitely.

625
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,580
It feels good.

626
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,550
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

627
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:18,820
Yes, we will come.

628
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
here here

629
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,400
What to do?

630
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,580
Go out, go out.

631
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:48,971
Sorry to

632
00:33:48,971 --> 00:33:51,111
I didn’t say the bus stop.

633
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:53,770
No, it doesn’t matter, I have to do that.

634
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,010
must do this.

635
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,440
You feel good, Siso.

636
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,230
very much.

637
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,930
Oh well was.

638
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,080
Send me a mail when I leave.

639
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,720
Shane, can you give me a bubble?

640
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,000
Ok to.

641
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,620
You can stream.

642
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,180
Is this going to sleep with you?

643
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,441
Oh, no, it is not a bit appropriate anymore.

644
00:34:50,441 --> 00:34:52,801
Sorry, it is really a bit appropriate.

645
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:55,560
It is fine, how are you concerned?

646
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,841
Thanks, I will borrow you.

647
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:03,700
Sorry, but the bed is a bit small.

648
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,460
Is this not a crap?

649
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,900
What are you saying?

650
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,701
You are always sleeping with me, guys.

651
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:12,201
You are dating.

652
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,500
Yes, we are sleeping together.

653
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,000
Yes is it.

654
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,820
The clothes cannot be placed separately.

655
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,320
is.

656
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,540
Yes is it?

657
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,760
Yes is it.

658
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,280
Even though the night is still long.

659
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,100
Sleep slowly.

660
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,800
It is long, night.

661
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,880
Dad, can we go?

662
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,800
So let’s go.

663
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,761
and slowly.

664
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:42,420
Go to sleep slowly.

665
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,020
Because I do not interfere.

666
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,960
Sleep slowly.

667
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,460
Good night.

668
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,070
You should have slept and pulled the cloth.

669
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,690
Bed is bad.

670
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,910
In the hands of your father and mother,

671
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,990
When we go to bed with you,

672
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,910
It is also strange in reverse.

673
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,810
Change and well.

674
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,710
It is strange to sleep together.

675
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,011
If you were dating,

676
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:14,310
Sleep together.

677
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:24,640
Go sleep with me, as usual.

678
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,760
Oh yeah yeah yeah

679
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,060
Sleep together.

680
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,521
You are nervous today.

681
00:36:36,521 --> 00:36:42,001
It was the first time I had that kind of greeting, so I was nervous.

682
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:48,021
I was so excited and wanted to get rid of Coke.

683
00:36:48,021 --> 00:36:49,521
Oh is?

684
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,320
The Dutch?

685
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,580
Yes, it is always. – As usual.

686
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,740
A vacation before going to bed.

687
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,230
The vacation chick.

688
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,970
As usual as usual.

689
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,310
So I will.

690
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,470
Yes to.

691
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:24,521
A little better.

692
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:26,610
As always

693
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,660
always is

694
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,910
that

695
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,311
A little

696
00:37:54,311 --> 00:37:55,051
What do you.

697
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:57,611
What do you.

698
00:37:57,611 --> 00:38:12,111
What do you.

699
00:38:12,111 --> 00:38:14,711
Do not have to go here.

700
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:16,551
well now

701
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:18,051
No is

702
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,911


703
00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:27,710
Watch from Sion.

704
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,740
Yes is.

705
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,040
I look, I look.

706
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,150
Daddy and mother.

707
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,430
must continue

708
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,390
I will be loved.

709
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,060
Now, at the moment

710
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:35,620


711
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,980
What happened?

712
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,060
You said.

713
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,240
It’s a show, so you don’t have to go here.

714
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:09,001
No, but if you don’t, your father and mother may die.

715
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:11,820
I need to seek reality.

716
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,060
No so is.

717
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,861
My mom and dad went there, so we went to sleep.

718
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:19,861
No, but I do not know.

719
00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:25,260
Maybe he was still behind the door.

720
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,241
again is

721
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:28,220
Let us sleep.

722
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,201
Again on the wall.

723
00:40:30,201 --> 00:40:30,861
Because this follows...

724
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,700
Okay, let’s go to sleep.

725
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,580
I will take it out of your mouth.

726
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,960
So is okay.

727
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,930
This is dirty, so I drink it.

728
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,270
Better to drink.

729
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,021
You are already a binary.

730
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:30,220
At work, do so with attention.

731
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,111
Do not look too much.

732
00:41:49,111 --> 00:41:51,610
But yes is.

733
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,050
Yes, is well

734
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,920
Continue to.

735
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,140
You do not need to have breasts.

736
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,180
No to no.

737
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,621
See also Continued.

738
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:57,120
No more

739
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,490
Yes

740
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,710


741
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,311


742
00:43:47,311 --> 00:43:49,350
Yes

743
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,390
No to

744
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,830
Go home tomorrow morning, when you get home.

745
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:38,170
Of course I go home.

746
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:43,270
This happened on Monday in the company.

747
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:46,030
Do not be happy.

748
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:52,650
Yes, I think I can normally.

749
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:53,211
Yes to.

750
00:44:53,211 --> 00:44:53,611
Yes to.

751
00:44:53,611 --> 00:45:02,990
Siro’s that, operation, oxy, chickpeak, feel easy, sickness, or something like that, I will never say, even if I speak.

752
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,811
Not full of courage.

753
00:45:04,811 --> 00:45:08,570
No, I am not saying, that is.

754
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,131
I promise, really

755
00:45:13,131 --> 00:45:14,930
I will not say, I will not say.

756
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,800
It is easy to paint, it is easy to paint, it is not so, I will not say, so be calm.

757
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,180
You don’t have to say that every time.

758
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,330
If you say something.

759
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:45,740
No, it is okay, I don’t say that.

760
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,620
I do not say anything bad.

761
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,101
Good or definitely good.

762
00:45:54,101 --> 00:46:05,900
But thank you today.

763
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:15,040
If there is anything else that helps, I will go.

764
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:21,201
Sorry, but I said I had to drink.

765
00:46:21,201 --> 00:46:22,840
No to?

766
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,130
No to?

767
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:50,650
No to?

768
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,580
No to?

769
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:17,590
No to?

770
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,660
Oh, wait a little.

771
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,190
Tish and Tish.

772
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,010
Is it okay?

773
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,890
Yes

774
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,580
So go to sleep.

775
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:16,580
I sleep on my right side as much as possible.

776
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,640
Sleep on your left as much as possible.

777
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,980
Then

778
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,401
Oh good night.

779
00:48:31,401 --> 00:48:34,000
Good night.

780
00:48:51,970 --> 00:49:01,851
Oh well.

781
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:04,390
He is dead.

782
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,680
is noisy

783
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,890
Mr Sato

784
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,250
Yes

785
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:19,071
What are you doing, Mr. Sato?

786
00:55:19,071 --> 00:55:20,470
Wait a little.

787
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:23,311
What this, a little.

788
00:55:23,311 --> 00:55:25,350
Mr Sato

789
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,030
Where to lick.

790
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,361
A little

791
00:55:35,361 --> 00:55:37,500
Mr Sato is

792
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:50,330
Really not.

793
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,561
A little

794
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:53,420
No, a little

795
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,200
A little

796
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:01,861
that

797
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:04,120
No to

798
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,780
What are you thinking?

799
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,280
What to enter.

800
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:15,600
No to no.

801
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:48,201
It is open.

802
00:56:48,201 --> 00:56:49,701
It is open.

803
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,620
A little

804
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:03,810
Is it awakening?

805
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:08,711
Let’s have breakfast.

806
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:10,211
Good morning

807
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:11,431
Good morning.

808
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:14,570
It was clear today.

809
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,591
Good electricity.

810
00:57:16,591 --> 00:57:18,630
Good morning mother.

811
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:22,590
We will both have breakfast.

812
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:24,511
something

813
00:57:24,511 --> 00:57:29,271
It seems like East Coast has been working.

814
00:57:29,271 --> 00:57:33,691
Yes, I have to go out in the morning.

815
00:57:33,691 --> 00:57:38,951
Oh, yes, my mom had me ready for breakfast.

816
00:57:38,951 --> 00:57:40,731
Sorry, but hurry a little.

817
00:57:40,731 --> 00:57:44,150
Will Sio go with me?

818
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:47,610
No, I have something to do.

819
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:51,031
Yes, I won’t go with you.

820
00:57:51,031 --> 00:57:54,851
So, you can get dressed up and go for breakfast.

821
00:57:54,851 --> 00:57:58,070
Sorry, I can’t do that kind job.

822
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:00,730
I’m waiting for you below.

823
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,120
I promise you to go out in the morning.

824
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,100
promise that.

825
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,400
Get ready and get out.

826
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:57,870
by

827
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,440
I guess I could only have a spoon.

828
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,461
No need to look here anymore.

829
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:08,141
Prepare to quickly.

830
00:59:08,141 --> 00:59:13,390
What this.

831
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:16,770
Because of me.

832
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,680
I think it’s weird to do something while I’m asleep.

833
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:33,131
Take it off or put your finger in.

834
00:59:33,131 --> 00:59:34,670
almost somewhere.

835
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,910
Okay, go out there.

836
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:41,830
Because we are lovers.

837
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:43,511
What a shameless thing.

838
00:59:43,511 --> 00:59:45,930
It ended yesterday.

839
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,060
Okay, leave it out.

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So, salt, you are so beautiful.

2
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,920
Well, I don’t buy much or anything.

3
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:14,600
Yes, you really live with Mr. Kowalski.

4
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,040
Yes, I live there though.

5
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,001
Not much too much?

6
01:00:19,001 --> 01:00:32,740
I have just moved recently, but I haven’t moved yet.

7
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,240
Is it so?

8
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,700
But let’s get a little around here.

9
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,200
Do you have toothbrushes in front of the TV?

10
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:51,340
Yes, I’ve just cleaned it up and left it somewhat weird.

11
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,860
Oh yes.

12
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,100
So what, is it Tada?

13
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:04,400
Oh, what, I’m ready to move now.

14
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,100
I said it before, but I am moving.

15
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,740
Maybe they are going to pick up their bags.

16
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,920
Oh, can I help you?

17
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,621
Yes, because my mother is coming.

18
01:01:14,621 --> 01:01:16,820
Sorry to.

19
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:21,640
Oh is?

20
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:26,270
Yes, that is what.

21
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:29,010
Just ask for convenience.

22
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:30,950
You have a plan, right?

23
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,810
Oh, there is something?

24
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:37,890
Climbing the mountain alone.

25
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:39,390
The mountain climb?

26
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,870
The hobby.

27
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:43,250
Well, it is probably so.

28
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:47,211
This weekend, it was a bad weather.

29
01:01:47,211 --> 01:01:49,651
The view is good.

30
01:01:49,651 --> 01:01:51,391
I have not slept lately.

31
01:01:51,391 --> 01:01:53,291
Next week will be okay.

32
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:54,951
Please really.

33
01:01:54,951 --> 01:01:56,431
Because I do anything.

34
01:01:56,431 --> 01:01:57,931
Anything is?

35
01:01:58,470 --> 01:01:59,850
Yes

36
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:04,800
Anything really?

37
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,300
Yes

38
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:12,591
Anything is okay.

39
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:16,150
Yes, if I could do what I could.

40
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,871
Oh, and so on.

41
01:02:19,871 --> 01:02:23,930
There is nothing but Mr. Sato.

42
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:26,450
I said, whatever.

43
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:31,391
As it was last time.

44
01:02:31,391 --> 01:02:34,891
Oh, oh, oh, that is a matter of fact.

45
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:36,871
What do you say in the company?

46
01:02:36,871 --> 01:02:38,371
Oh what

47
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,560
Oh what is.

48
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:44,480
So about helping.

49
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,040
to lick.

50
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,500
Oh that.

51
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,761
It was flowing before.

52
01:02:55,761 --> 01:02:58,880
The atmosphere of that place.

53
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,640
Oh, but I am fine.

54
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,421
Every day he is being demonized by his father.

55
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:11,200
It doesn’t matter to me that you were caught.

56
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,740
What to do?

57
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,121
It depends on Sato.

58
01:03:19,121 --> 01:03:25,630
I think I’d be either.

59
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:30,100
If you listen to that request.

60
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,460
Will you continue to cooperate?

61
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:41,210
Thinking about what can we help?

62
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:46,270
What to do?

63
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:51,871
Just like before, just go to the mouth.

64
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:53,371
really is?

65
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:54,711
Yes

66
01:03:54,711 --> 01:03:58,791
So, let me give you.

67
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:00,730
OK is.

68
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:04,111
So then, then then then.

69
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:06,131
Oh, and here?

70
01:04:06,131 --> 01:04:07,631
Oh is?

71
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:10,630
Talk about now, right?

72
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:20,571
Only here is.

73
01:04:20,571 --> 01:04:23,431
He seems to have gone home with the boss.

74
01:04:23,431 --> 01:04:24,931
Only now.

75
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:32,930
Why are you growing up now?

76
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:37,281
Sorry sorry sorry

77
01:04:37,281 --> 01:04:41,720
Okay okay?

78
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:10,180
The girl moves.

79
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,780
What are you filming? is it stupid?

80
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:38,940
Because not can?

81
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:40,361
You are determined not.

82
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:44,721
No, I think I am a personal person.

83
01:05:44,721 --> 01:05:46,740
Is it over?

84
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,180
It is no longer over.

85
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:50,501
So then then

86
01:05:50,501 --> 01:05:52,821
Never show it to anyone.

87
01:05:52,821 --> 01:05:55,360
Yes, I will not.

88
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:29,220
Oh, Mr. Sasha, you are so good.

89
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,821
No to

90
01:06:36,821 --> 01:06:38,321
No to

91
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,380
No to

92
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,401
No to

93
01:06:41,401 --> 01:06:42,901
No to

94
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,040
No to

95
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,481
No to well.

96
01:06:48,481 --> 01:06:50,100
is good.

97
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,140
Not so though.

98
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:56,021
No to

99
01:06:56,021 --> 01:06:57,221
Cut off.

100
01:06:57,221 --> 01:07:03,621
that is

101
01:07:03,621 --> 01:07:05,021
that

102
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:09,441
Just move, just sit down, and move like this.

103
01:07:09,441 --> 01:07:11,520
Okay is?

104
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,700
Oh yeah, thou shalt

105
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:19,520
Oh, this is good.

106
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,440
something completely different.

107
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:27,840
What, what what what happened?

108
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,580
What happened?

109
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,100
was too hard.

110
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,720
Sorry to sorry.

111
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,960
Great to

112
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:57,310
Is it okay?

113
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:01,610
I want you to sit a little.

114
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:14,090
Yes Yes Yes

115
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:21,770
sweetly

116
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,221
What do you touch?

117
01:08:41,221 --> 01:08:43,900
No, I would rather do this.

118
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:46,540
I can go fast.

119
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:50,440
Just a little.

120
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:52,330
Are you looking at your breasts?

121
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:56,191
I thought I had not seen my breasts.

122
01:09:56,191 --> 01:10:01,750
by Brist

123
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:06,241
Oh yeah yeah

124
01:10:06,241 --> 01:10:07,920
I want to continue.

125
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,540
by Brist

126
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:27,620
Feel good

127
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:07,860
Feels good?

128
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,041
Feel good

129
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:10,860
Very good feeling.

130
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,980
Oh is

131
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,421
Oh is

132
01:11:14,421 --> 01:11:16,001
A little Suzuki.

133
01:11:16,001 --> 01:11:18,000
was perfect.

134
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:35,410
that is

135
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:37,851
That gold.

136
01:11:37,851 --> 01:11:39,990
Can not drink.

137
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:41,610
Oh well

138
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:44,330
Oh, I’ll be lying here.

139
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,961
No more move.

140
01:12:10,961 --> 01:12:14,320
But it felt good and it moved immediately.

141
01:12:48,920 --> 01:13:13,111
I have to go quickly.

142
01:13:13,111 --> 01:13:14,411
be hasty.

143
01:13:14,411 --> 01:13:19,070
No, but I am not in a hurry.

144
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:30,791
It is crazy.

145
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:34,150
Everyone has returned.

146
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:37,991
Because I say I’m going to do this.

147
01:13:37,991 --> 01:13:43,270
Now I can’t pull it back.

148
01:13:46,430 --> 01:14:03,730
Is it good, good, good, good feeling?

149
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:10,320
Oh shit, I am going out.

150
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:25,740
Dad, what do I do?

151
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:28,740
No, what to do.

152
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:33,580
What to do.

153
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,640
Put it out like this.

154
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,180
Sorry to sorry.

155
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:44,480
Wait a little, wait a little.

156
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,321
Tishy

157
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:48,981
This is a beautiful guy.

158
01:14:48,981 --> 01:14:50,801
It is neither clean nor dirty.

159
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:52,701
Okay but thank you.

160
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:55,340
Yes, I clean it up.

161
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,741
Why put so much in it?

162
01:14:58,741 --> 01:15:02,821
No, because it is not.

163
01:15:02,821 --> 01:15:05,201
He has gone out.

164
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:07,780
Oh my shirt, come in.

165
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:10,740
Because I promise.

166
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:14,000
This weekend, you have not forgotten.

167
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,900
Yes, this weekend though.

168
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,101
Please please.

169
01:15:17,101 --> 01:15:19,421
So, dress up quickly.

170
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:21,460
Because he just came home.

171
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,400
Is the seed okay?

172
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,080
Okay now.

173
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:35,660
But, you know, your mother married and went home.

174
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:49,060
When your mother came into the house, your father worked hard, built the house, and you also did the job in school.

175
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:55,340
But we both have a relationship that supports work.

176
01:15:55,340 --> 01:16:01,380
I think I might be worried if I miss my job.

177
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:06,260
In business or in private, I want to be with you.

178
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,180
Oh, you have come.

179
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:10,980
Is it Tajo?

180
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,140
Yes, look at me a little.

181
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:17,140
Do you really live?

182
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,960
Did you go wrong?

183
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:23,860
It is noisy.

184
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:28,721
No, because I don’t know you’re coming for the first time.

185
01:16:28,721 --> 01:16:30,301
Yes is it.

186
01:16:30,301 --> 01:16:34,360
And the address I sent you was different.

187
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,841
I and my brother have gotten a little bit of a goo.

188
01:16:37,841 --> 01:16:39,501
Gulliver? is it

189
01:16:39,501 --> 01:16:42,700
Oh well mother.

190
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:49,541
I think they live together, but they are suspicious.

191
01:16:49,541 --> 01:16:53,681
Yes, I know, I have nothing to do with me.

192
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:55,360
It is.

193
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,581
Come in now.

194
01:16:57,581 --> 01:16:59,360
Oh, a little

195
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:11,740
Just now.

196
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:13,240
Welcome to.

197
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,160
I am hindering you.

198
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,940
Were you here?

199
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,660
Welcome to.

200
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,380
Just now.

201
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:25,740
Oh this.

202
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,240
thanks to.

203
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:36,660
Do not calm down at home.

204
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:39,700
Yes, you are tired.

205
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,220
You always leave it here.

206
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,600
The suitcase is here.

207
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,780
Oh my mother.

208
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,280
thanks to.

209
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:02,501
Yes, it is good to have your own home.

210
01:18:02,501 --> 01:18:04,001
Yes is.

211
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,080
I want to get that, that, and everything else here.

212
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:18,980
Yes, because I only have this.

213
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,480
It is true, right?

214
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:27,870
Today was the day to change your toothbrush.

215
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:29,370
Yes is.

216
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:31,151
Change it every week?

217
01:18:31,151 --> 01:18:32,591
Yes, I am changing every week.

218
01:18:32,591 --> 01:18:36,590
It is important, because it is important.

219
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,700
Thanks, I am full of it, okay.

220
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:42,540
It was heavy. – He was heavy.

221
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:47,780
Let’s have a toast, right?

222
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:51,440
I bought it right now, okay? Oh thank you.

223
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,720
Please choose what you like.

224
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:58,000
Do you always buy it like this? Yes is.

225
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,201
When I get home, I’m mostly going to dinner.

226
01:19:01,201 --> 01:19:02,380
It is so.

227
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:02,860
Which is good?

228
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:05,580
So let me go here.

229
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,120
Which is good?

230
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,460
from now on.

231
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:10,140
I am this.

232
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:12,800
Is it okay?

233
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:13,540
Yes it is okay.

234
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:14,600
I will open.

235
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,380
thanks to.

236
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:16,640
Then I open.

237
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,220
Okay well okay.

238
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,140
something is,

239
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:20,920
I am always like that too.

240
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,240
Then then,

241
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:24,420
thanks to.

242
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:25,260
and again.

243
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,760
well is.

244
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:29,341
Toast to.

245
01:19:29,341 --> 01:19:33,941
I just said I wanted salt and I wanted to go.

246
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:36,720
Something will feel like that.

247
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:38,940
Yes, of course it is.

248
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:42,001
Yes, I will go back.

249
01:19:42,001 --> 01:19:45,580
So when is the move completed?

250
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,800
Yes, what was it?

251
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,861
You are moving now.

252
01:19:50,861 --> 01:19:52,781
Move on, yes

253
01:19:52,781 --> 01:19:55,840
Oh well...

254
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:08,580
You live together, so think well.

255
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:10,300
said it was not.

256
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,980
You are a company, right?

257
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:20,660
Does your company have people who expect to speak?

258
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:26,181
First of all, there are not many women, so it is not so bad.

259
01:20:26,181 --> 01:20:27,681
Yes to?

260
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,560
Oh yeah yes.

261
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:33,500
Not a little to fix.

262
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,080
You came out of town when you came out of town, right?

263
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:41,180
It is good to enter the family.

264
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:43,220
Did I say that?

265
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:45,360
What I said, it was true.

266
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,600
Oh yeah then yes.

267
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,400
and no.

268
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:53,301
Yes, women come into the house.

269
01:20:53,301 --> 01:20:56,341
The men work outside.

270
01:20:56,341 --> 01:21:01,300
To support the family as a pillar.

271
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,480
The secret is, it will work.

272
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:08,640
My mom drinks too much tea.

273
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:12,081
Okay, okay now you too.

274
01:21:12,081 --> 01:21:13,021
Can you go home properly?

275
01:21:13,021 --> 01:21:16,341
Do not say work.

276
01:21:16,341 --> 01:21:20,440
Think about having children, right?

277
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:23,741
I still don’t know.

278
01:21:23,741 --> 01:21:29,680
Oh, baby, you have a tooth in your stomach.

279
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:31,420
Meaning is

280
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:34,020
If you were born at 20 years old.

281
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:36,420
You have to think, right?

282
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:41,280
After 30 years, you have a birth.

283
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:46,480
It is hard, Mr. Tohoku.

284
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,000
Yes, you think so, right?

285
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,380
I think, yes

286
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:55,620
It’s not your mother’s problem, right?

287
01:21:55,640 --> 01:22:04,980
No matter what, you are in the sea, and you will not get married.

288
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:11,981
Mr. Todd, I don’t think you’re going to go anywhere.

289
01:22:11,981 --> 01:22:15,741
Oh, I’m not the type of shit.

290
01:22:15,741 --> 01:22:19,080
He is more attracted to my ass than me.

291
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,280
You want to work, right?

292
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,780
Yes yes but.

293
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:29,021
You are getting that feeling.

294
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:31,301
Okay, that is a place.

295
01:22:31,301 --> 01:22:34,240
Do not let me endure.

296
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:38,221
You are your mom, it is time to go home.

297
01:22:38,221 --> 01:22:42,061
What, it is still okay.

298
01:22:42,061 --> 01:22:44,640
I should have come with your father.

299
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:54,640
Well, Mr. Kowalski, now I’ll be going home and leave my family.

300
01:22:54,980 --> 01:23:02,440
I have to take a horse, take a tower, go to Gigi.

301
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,180
Guggy

302
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:05,301
Yes

303
01:23:05,301 --> 01:23:06,901
Don’t have to ask, Mr. Kowalski.

304
01:23:06,901 --> 01:23:11,600
What about the job? – Not even the chance of a life out.

305
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,360
Well, it feels like a dirt.

306
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,640
It seems you are already working hard.

307
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:25,300
So, it’s time to get married and try it.

308
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:29,300
Otherwise, I could not have been born before.

309
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:31,140
Oh, was it so?

310
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,140
is married.

311
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:34,640
Not told to?

312
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,021
There was not much around me.

313
01:23:38,021 --> 01:23:45,960
Now it’s time for women to work, isn’t it?

314
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,280
Isn’t that a little room for the men?

315
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,560
Oh, maybe it may be.

316
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,620
You are not married to a boss, right?

317
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,460
The boss is married.

318
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:05,060
It is important to say marriage.

319
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:05,900
Certainly.

320
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:06,820
It is cool.

321
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:16,320
This is a shot, but Mr. Oakley must hold his attention and pull him to death.

322
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:22,020
You are ready to live with them, right?

323
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:28,340
Yes, of course, I mean living together.

324
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:30,780
You will care about it, right?

325
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:32,280
I intend to.

326
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,040
Yes is.

327
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:42,290
I love the salt.

328
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:45,110
I will care.

329
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:48,190
Good was.

330
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:55,250
I want to see my grandson’s face.

331
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,420
My mother slept.

332
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:06,000
I will bring a little bracket.

333
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:26,540
If you sleep here, you get a cold.

334
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:31,340
The cold will fall.

335
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:33,370
Is it okay?

336
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:36,251
Go to bed in the morning, it will be light.

337
01:25:36,251 --> 01:25:37,751
Yes

338
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:42,090
Oh yeah, and so on.

339
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:43,890
Yes to?

340
01:25:44,730 --> 01:25:46,830
So what, what then?

341
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,990
Just said

342
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:50,830
What is?

343
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:54,480
Her mother is.

344
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,120
I told him to get married soon.

345
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,040
I told you.

346
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,600
Oh is?

347
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,100
Did you say something?

348
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:06,640
You said.

349
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,900
I get it somehow.

350
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,641
Sorry, what did you say?

351
01:26:12,641 --> 01:26:15,000
No longer enough.

352
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,641
Let her mother sleep.

353
01:26:16,641 --> 01:26:17,881
Oh yeah, it looks like.

354
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:20,700
will fall.

355
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,281
by

356
01:26:22,281 --> 01:26:24,700
well is

357
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:27,120
well well well

358
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,720
This is OK.

359
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:30,961
Time to go home.

360
01:26:30,961 --> 01:26:33,341
Go home to

361
01:26:33,341 --> 01:26:34,621
How to do.

362
01:26:34,621 --> 01:26:36,700
No final train?

363
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:38,601
Oh is

364
01:26:38,601 --> 01:26:47,300
I think you’re enjoying it, or a taxi.

365
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:52,700
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

366
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,200
Walk along the way and take a taxi.

367
01:26:57,340 --> 01:27:02,620
I would rather enjoy it if it was real.

368
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:05,700
Okay, I am sorry for that.

369
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:09,060
I couldn’t, I came today.

370
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,880
No, but it is absolutely okay.

371
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:20,460
If she wasn’t there when she woke up in the morning, she would rest.

372
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:41,440
Let me sleep here, and sleep with you both.

373
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:49,251
Put it now?

374
01:27:49,251 --> 01:27:51,750
No, I will finish later.

375
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:23,240
I only have a pyjama at home.

376
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,061
Oh yeah, now it is.

377
01:28:26,061 --> 01:28:28,740
If it were your own home.

378
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:43,300
Can I borrow this?

379
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:46,580
I want to sleep here.

380
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:51,961
Go to bed normally on top.

381
01:28:51,961 --> 01:28:57,141
Oh, no, my mom is already sleeping.

382
01:28:57,141 --> 01:28:59,981
You will not come to see.

383
01:28:59,981 --> 01:29:04,701
Not a day for a boyfriend or anything.

384
01:29:04,701 --> 01:29:07,121
I think it’s better to sleep separately.

385
01:29:07,121 --> 01:29:09,440
Yes, no longer

386
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:13,560
Okay, I can sleep here.

387
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,461
Do not care.

388
01:29:14,461 --> 01:29:18,321
But I don’t look like you were before.

389
01:29:18,321 --> 01:29:23,380
Instead, you should sleep normally.

390
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,681
I had to come here for that.

391
01:29:27,681 --> 01:29:31,680
I cannot say you sleep in the opposite.

392
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:40,030
I have always heard your mother’s stories.

393
01:29:40,030 --> 01:29:43,650
No, not in any way.

394
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:47,650
So keep your words.

395
01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:48,671
Yes

396
01:29:48,671 --> 01:29:55,200
I’ll go to this floor.

397
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:10,751
Yes

398
01:30:10,751 --> 01:30:11,310
Macro is

399
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:12,891
Okay, I cannot use it.

400
01:30:12,891 --> 01:30:17,190
Macro is okay, yes, yes.

401
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:36,590
Oh well good night.

402
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:41,490
Oh good night.

403
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:37,571
Even if it was a play.

404
01:31:37,571 --> 01:31:40,291
Not so is it.

405
01:31:40,291 --> 01:31:40,990
No to

406
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:43,510
Don’t say anything strange, I go to bed.

407
01:31:43,690 --> 01:31:48,150
No, maybe that,

408
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:51,361
Maybe you’ll come to see it.

409
01:31:51,361 --> 01:31:52,621
I am not coming to see.

410
01:31:52,621 --> 01:31:56,161
My mother is drunk and she will not wake up when she sleeps.

411
01:31:56,161 --> 01:32:00,580
No, that is all good.

412
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:09,160
If you think it’s a play, you might still doubt.

413
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,400
Thinking too much.

414
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,880
What are you touching?

415
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:23,480
No, I thought it would be better to have a wall and a love.

416
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,481
I didn’t get cold until then.

417
01:32:26,481 --> 01:32:28,200
How is it.

418
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:31,080
Sorry to say.

419
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,000
No to no.

420
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:41,250
Maybe if

421
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:41,971
Now is

422
01:32:41,971 --> 01:32:45,431
You may listen to the wall.

423
01:32:45,431 --> 01:32:47,570
Not listening to.

424
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:49,631
No, I am lying, I don’t know.

425
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:50,930
Have you seen?

426
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:51,631
I have not seen.

427
01:32:51,631 --> 01:32:53,811
I have not seen.

428
01:32:53,811 --> 01:32:55,570
A bit of.

429
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:57,710
Do not smell.

430
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:00,110
Not a little.

431
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:04,790
Now I am going to sleep.

432
01:33:05,010 --> 01:33:09,271
Okay, so stay here and sleep here.

433
01:33:09,271 --> 01:33:11,090
The back?

434
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:14,950
Just calm down here.

435
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:18,610
Okay then then.

436
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,621
Good night.

437
01:33:22,621 --> 01:33:25,940
Good night.

438
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:41,700
Not on the back, but on the hands.

439
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:44,700
You put it on your seat, right?

440
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,700
I want to sit.

441
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:01,080
No to

442
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:07,520
Do not touch the neck.

443
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:10,070
not do it.

444
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:12,510
You don’t have lips.

445
01:34:12,790 --> 01:34:14,971
I have thick lips.

446
01:34:14,971 --> 01:34:17,290
It does not matter.

447
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:22,281
Not really.

448
01:34:22,281 --> 01:34:24,780
It is back.

449
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:31,360
No to

450
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:38,781
What are you doing.

451
01:34:38,781 --> 01:34:41,220
Because tell me.

452
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:53,351
What are you doing.

453
01:34:53,351 --> 01:34:55,850
No, no to

454
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:03,071
No, no, no no

455
01:35:03,071 --> 01:35:06,850
We are not real lovers.

456
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:13,030
Not a lover.

457
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,820
No, no no

458
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:22,160
No to

459
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:25,710

460
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:28,231
If not not.

461
01:35:28,231 --> 01:35:30,230
Do not do it.

462
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:40,581
Oh, a little

463
01:35:40,581 --> 01:35:42,220
and more and more.

464
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:54,100
What are you doing.

465
01:35:57,540 --> 01:36:00,440
Try to touch there.

466
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,901
If you are a lover, you will.

467
01:36:10,901 --> 01:36:13,040
If you were a lover.

468
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:18,000
No to

469
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:22,390
No to

470
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:30,360
Something is hidden.

471
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:32,741
No to

472
01:36:32,741 --> 01:36:37,280
No to

473
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,780
If you are visible.

474
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:58,221
Do not eat a little.

475
01:36:58,221 --> 01:36:59,721
No to

476
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,380
My mother came.

477
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:05,420
was evident.

478
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,641
No to

479
01:37:07,641 --> 01:37:08,801
Let her wake up.

480
01:37:08,801 --> 01:37:10,240
Wake up.

481
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:13,381
Where we are in love.

482
01:37:13,381 --> 01:37:17,990
The mothers are reassured.

483
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:22,671
I would not like to see such a mother.

484
01:37:22,671 --> 01:37:25,170
Oh yeah

485
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:29,650
Oh yeah

486
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:35,480
A little

487
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:48,090
Oh yeah

488
01:37:57,710 --> 01:37:59,250
Oh yeah

489
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:00,951
Oh yeah

490
01:38:00,951 --> 01:38:01,591
Oh yeah

491
01:38:01,591 --> 01:38:05,191
Oh yeah

492
01:38:05,191 --> 01:38:05,451
by

493
01:38:05,451 --> 01:38:06,991
If you have such a relationship.

494
01:38:06,991 --> 01:38:09,691
What to look like in the company.

495
01:38:09,691 --> 01:38:11,351
I do not, I

496
01:38:11,351 --> 01:38:13,011
The street now.

497
01:38:13,011 --> 01:38:14,050
Do it to.

498
01:38:14,050 --> 01:38:16,430
You cannot do.

499
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:23,401
Because it is one day.

500
01:38:23,401 --> 01:38:25,060
by you there.

501
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:37,721
You came here with your hands.

502
01:38:37,721 --> 01:38:40,460
No more, no more.

503
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:45,460
Stay away and stay away.

504
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:58,420
I will not be able to see the river at work.

505
01:38:58,420 --> 01:39:05,820
I will not see.

506
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:13,860
Oh, a little

507
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:21,561
So let’s try a little.

508
01:39:21,561 --> 01:39:23,061
The Rivers

509
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:27,920
Oh well, oh well

510
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:39,330
Oh, a little

511
01:39:53,420 --> 01:40:02,300

512
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:05,940
If you really do dish, no.

513
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:07,041
No dish.

514
01:40:07,041 --> 01:40:09,540
Oh oh oh

01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:12,610

Yes is

525
01:41:00,751 --> 01:41:03,210
Why is

526
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:06,351
Tell me.

527
01:41:06,351 --> 01:41:08,131
Talk to

528
01:41:08,131 --> 01:41:12,790
What are you doing? what are you doing?

529
01:41:12,790 --> 01:41:14,590
It is lying.

530
01:41:36,650 --> 01:41:42,960
What are you thinking? what are you doing?

531
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:45,901
No, what do I do.

532
01:41:45,901 --> 01:41:49,420
Why do you put your finger?

533
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:51,421
No more no.

534
01:41:51,421 --> 01:41:53,900
Do not put your fingers.

535
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,420
Why is?

It is true that the work is not done.

105
02:08:40,271 --> 02:08:42,351
This has to be done a little.

106

No, no, it is dirty!

02:29:21,181 --> 02:29:23,320
You are still working.

293
02:29:24,340 --> 02:29:26,160
A little left.

294
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:28,141
I forgot my phone.

295
02:29:28,141 --> 02:29:30,521
Yes, only what I forget.

296
02:29:30,521 --> 02:29:32,941
You have to be careful, right?

297
02:29:32,941 --> 02:29:35,200
I said I didnâ€™t want to say it before.

298
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:37,280
I forgot you, you

299
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:39,510
Because it was good.

300
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:43,480
What, are you still not done?

301
02:29:43,500 --> 02:29:44,940
Yes to.

302
02:29:44,940 --> 02:29:46,900
How much is left, you?

303
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:49,500
No, that and that,

304
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:50,701
and that,

305
02:29:50,701 --> 02:29:52,740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

306
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:55,140
It is a complex document.

307
02:29:55,980 --> 02:29:57,000
Oh,

308
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,140
What is?

309
02:29:58,140 --> 02:30:00,401
Be careful of forgotten things.

310
02:30:00,401 --> 02:30:02,001
Come to understand.

311
02:30:02,001 --> 02:30:04,281
What are you doing in that century?

312
02:30:04,281 --> 02:30:06,020
What is what?

313
02:30:06,020 --> 02:30:08,061
This is not your century.

314
02:30:08,061 --> 02:30:10,881
No, that computer

315
02:30:10,881 --> 02:30:12,081
A little bit.

316
02:30:12,081 --> 02:30:13,221
I freeze it.

317
02:30:13,221 --> 02:30:16,660
The freeze?

318
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:18,661
You probably didnâ€™t destroy it.

319
02:30:18,661 --> 02:30:20,581
No, no is not.

320
02:30:20,581 --> 02:30:22,501
And in the urgent.

321
02:30:22,501 --> 02:30:24,800
Because I have to do.

322
02:30:25,160 --> 02:30:26,840
With Mr. Sato

323
02:30:27,820 --> 02:30:29,821
What happened to Mr. Sato?

324
02:30:29,821 --> 02:30:34,320
Oh, oh, I have gotten home.

325
02:30:34,340 --> 02:30:36,380
Have you already gone home?

326
02:30:36,380 --> 02:30:37,400
I went home.

327
02:30:37,400 --> 02:30:40,320
At least, at least once more.

328
02:30:40,320 --> 02:30:42,440
You seem to be busy.

329
02:30:44,020 --> 02:30:46,200
How many minutes ago did you come home?

330
02:30:46,660 --> 02:30:51,620
I thought I was back ten or fifteen minutes ago.

331
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:56,180
No, I seem to be busy.

332
02:30:56,680 --> 02:30:58,180
Yes is

333
02:30:58,580 --> 02:31:01,300
Come back when youâ€™re done, change.

334
02:31:01,580 --> 02:31:03,301
Oh yeah, I canâ€™t.

335
02:31:03,301 --> 02:31:04,440
Oh to?

336
02:31:04,440 --> 02:31:06,681
No, I want to go.

337
02:31:06,681 --> 02:31:08,461
I want to go.

338
02:31:08,461 --> 02:31:09,201
Yes is

339
02:31:09,201 --> 02:31:16,800
by

340
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:18,981
See also Mr. Hato.

341
02:31:18,981 --> 02:31:21,260
Maybe a boyfriend.

342
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:24,401
No, no no

343
02:31:24,401 --> 02:31:26,420
How about you?

344
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:29,601
No, I do not know.

345
02:31:29,601 --> 02:31:32,100
Probably not there.

346
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:35,961
You should ask yourself.

347
02:31:35,961 --> 02:31:38,620
You donâ€™t listen to it, itâ€™s so direct.

348
02:31:38,620 --> 02:31:40,760
How about marriage.

349
02:31:40,760 --> 02:31:42,101
I said something.

350
02:31:42,101 --> 02:31:44,021
No, it is so.

351
02:31:44,021 --> 02:31:45,081
But is

352
02:31:45,081 --> 02:31:47,641
I said it wasnâ€™t before I heard it.

353
02:31:47,641 --> 02:31:49,200
There is no.

354
02:31:49,260 --> 02:31:51,061
Maybe it is now.

355
02:31:51,061 --> 02:31:52,541
No no no no no.

356
02:31:52,541 --> 02:31:55,001
Because it is a job.

357
02:31:55,001 --> 02:31:57,180
Oh so it feels.

358
02:31:57,180 --> 02:32:00,340
Yes, because he is a serious person.

359
02:32:01,240 --> 02:32:03,261
I know there is no.

360
02:32:03,261 --> 02:32:04,621
No to No.

361
02:32:04,621 --> 02:32:06,121
What is?

362
02:32:06,740 --> 02:32:08,360
No to no.

363
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:10,440
The Me?

364
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:12,620
Did you say that?

365
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:14,420
I said it.

366
02:32:14,940 --> 02:32:18,280
You said nothing.

367
02:32:18,280 --> 02:32:20,501
Iâ€™m there, Iâ€™m there, Iâ€™m there with my phone.

368
02:32:20,501 --> 02:32:23,401
No, there is no here.

369
02:32:23,401 --> 02:32:25,500
There is no here.

370
02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:29,020
Or not a toilet.

371
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:33,400
Iâ€™m not going to the toilet, guys.

372
02:32:38,320 --> 02:32:40,740
You should not look for the bottom.

373
02:32:40,740 --> 02:32:42,060
Why? why?

374
02:32:42,060 --> 02:32:45,640
No, I think not in some way.

375
02:32:55,600 --> 02:32:57,100
There was, there was.

376
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:01,260
It was good, right?

377
02:33:01,580 --> 02:33:04,500
Mr. Sasha, you are very close.

378
02:33:05,140 --> 02:33:07,020
I do not know the house.

379
02:33:07,020 --> 02:33:09,300
Oh, it was near.

380
02:33:09,300 --> 02:33:10,580
Oh yes is it?

381
02:33:10,580 --> 02:33:15,960
No, but if it is too hard,

382
02:33:16,100 --> 02:33:20,860
I can cut it off, no, itâ€™s not good.

383
02:33:20,860 --> 02:33:23,300
Yes, of course of course.

384
02:33:23,300 --> 02:33:26,520
Dad, I am really sorry to be cut.

385
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:26,681
Yes to.

386
02:33:26,681 --> 02:33:28,180
Go to go.

387
02:33:28,180 --> 02:33:28,341
Yes to.

388
02:33:28,341 --> 02:33:30,700
Come here when you are done.

389
02:33:31,780 --> 02:33:35,560
No, I donâ€™t want to go.

390
02:33:35,560 --> 02:33:36,721
Why is it.

391
02:33:36,721 --> 02:33:39,561
I have a tea, so come.

392
02:33:39,561 --> 02:33:42,801
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

393
02:33:42,801 --> 02:33:45,921
No, I donâ€™t want to go any longer, this.

394
02:33:45,921 --> 02:33:48,340
No, come to me.

395
02:33:48,340 --> 02:33:50,660
No, what to do.

396
02:33:53,340 --> 02:33:55,961
No, I donâ€™t want to go.

397
02:33:55,961 --> 02:33:58,461
Why not, come here.

398
02:33:58,461 --> 02:34:00,880
Yes, I go

399
02:34:01,560 --> 02:34:02,401
I go to

400
02:34:02,401 --> 02:34:03,760
Have gone?

401
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:04,641
Nothing is anything.

402
02:34:04,641 --> 02:34:06,720
Yes, are you going?

403
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:07,820
Yes

404
02:34:07,820 --> 02:34:08,820
Yes is

405
02:34:08,820 --> 02:34:10,920
So you will take it?

406
02:34:13,180 --> 02:34:13,501
Yes

407
02:34:13,501 --> 02:34:15,360
I go to the director.

408
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:16,861
I say coming from now.

409
02:34:16,861 --> 02:34:18,361
Oh well

410
02:34:19,580 --> 02:34:21,080
A little

411
02:34:21,580 --> 02:34:22,180
Yes is

412
02:34:22,180 --> 02:34:24,320
You will come.

413
02:34:24,940 --> 02:34:26,340
Oh a little.

414
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:28,841
Yes, later later

415
02:34:28,841 --> 02:34:30,660
I go to the director.

416
02:34:30,900 --> 02:34:32,880
When I feel good, I will enter.

417
02:35:20,390 --> 02:35:23,290
Going to Casablanca?

418
02:35:23,290 --> 02:35:24,151
I will not go.

419
02:35:24,151 --> 02:35:25,111
Go to

420
02:35:25,111 --> 02:35:27,950
You cannot go.

421
02:35:28,270 --> 02:35:30,950
Funny at that moment.

422
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:34,950
Siro is moving fast.

423
02:35:35,230 --> 02:35:36,251
I went out.

424
02:35:36,251 --> 02:35:38,410
You have gone out.

425
02:35:38,410 --> 02:35:41,910
Sorry, but I put my clothes on.

426
02:35:41,910 --> 02:35:42,310
OK is OK.

427
02:35:42,310 --> 02:35:46,770
I know you have a breast.

428
02:35:50,010 --> 02:35:51,510
Is it okay?

429
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:56,440
I will leave it here properly.

430
02:35:58,470 --> 02:36:01,630
I didnâ€™t know much about anything.

431
02:36:01,630 --> 02:36:06,230
It was Riga.

432
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:15,800
It is so terrible that Kobe is still falling.

433
02:36:16,780 --> 02:36:17,581
pleased

434
02:36:17,581 --> 02:36:36,440
Sorry to sorry.

435
02:36:49,140 --> 02:36:51,061
Feeled...

436
02:36:51,061 --> 02:36:52,401
Feels good?

437
02:36:52,401 --> 02:36:57,800
Feel good

438
02:37:02,050 --> 02:37:05,110
Feel good  Feel good

439
02:37:08,870 --> 02:37:10,031
Oh no more.

440
02:37:10,031 --> 02:37:10,651
go to

441
02:37:10,651 --> 02:37:12,151
Oh yeah

442
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:22,550
No problem.

443
02:37:22,550 --> 02:37:25,050
Because I will be scared.

444
02:37:32,330 --> 02:37:35,151
No longer good out.

445
02:37:35,151 --> 02:37:35,471
Probably

446
02:37:35,471 --> 02:37:37,790
Maybe is okay.

447
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:44,641
Yes

448
02:37:44,641 --> 02:37:45,841
It feels good here.

449
02:37:45,841 --> 02:37:48,281
It feels good here.

450
02:37:48,281 --> 02:37:49,781
Oh yeah

451
02:37:52,240 --> 02:37:53,740
Oh yeah

452
02:38:00,320 --> 02:38:04,641
hurt is hurt.

453
02:38:04,641 --> 02:38:10,731
hurt is hurt.

454
02:38:10,731 --> 02:38:11,391
hurtly

455
02:38:11,391 --> 02:38:12,891
hurt is hurt.

456
02:38:16,350 --> 02:38:19,011
It will suffer.

457
02:38:19,011 --> 02:38:20,131
It is OK.

458
02:38:20,131 --> 02:38:21,551
Tomorrow it will dry.

459
02:38:21,551 --> 02:38:22,671
Maybe dry.

460
02:38:22,671 --> 02:38:25,711
It will dry.

461
02:38:25,711 --> 02:38:30,791
Sex is

462
02:38:30,791 --> 02:38:39,250
I want to switch.

463
02:38:41,590 --> 02:38:43,571
It becomes pin.

464
02:38:43,571 --> 02:38:46,410
Give it in.

465
02:38:52,690 --> 02:39:02,871
Feel good

466
02:39:02,871 --> 02:39:04,371

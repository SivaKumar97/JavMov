1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm home.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Welcome home.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm home.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Ah, I'm tired.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Good work.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Good work.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You ate dinner, didn't you?

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, I did.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It was a convenience store bento at work.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Ah, I see.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's for tomorrow.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Ah, I see.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's for tomorrow.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ah, I see.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ah, I see.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I was making the documents for tomorrow.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Ah, I see.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I have a business trip tomorrow.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Are you okay? Aren't you tired?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, I'm a little tired, but I'm okay.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Really?

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
As usual.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm worried about you before the business trip.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Thank you.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I have a business trip tomorrow.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's in Hiroshima, but it's a big deal.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's a big deal.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
When it's over,

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I think I can take a break for a while.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Really?

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Don't overdo it.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank you.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll buy you a drink.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Really? I'm looking forward to it.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm looking forward to it.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Shinji.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm home.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Welcome home.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Shinji.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How's dinner?

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll make you something to eat.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Shinji.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I want you to make me something.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't be shy.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Don't be shy.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll make you something.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You haven't eaten anything today, have you?

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll take this.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll take this.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're not going to talk to me, are you?

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's okay.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's okay.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You've been ignoring me for two months.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You've been ignoring me for two months.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It'll take a little longer.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't think we'll get along.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't think we'll get along.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You don't have to worry.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I talked to you the other day.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I talked to you the other day.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Shinji was cheated on by his ex-girlfriend.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Shinji was cheated on by his ex-girlfriend.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He ran away.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He ran away.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He quit his job.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You know, I really like you.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But if that's what you want,

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But if that's what you want,

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't know what to do.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know what to do.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I just think of you as a little strange woman.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't know if it was a bad idea

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't know if it was a bad idea

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, it's almost time.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hmm.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Shinji is a good guy even if he's scared.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Is that so?

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know about that yet.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, I haven't talked to him yet.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Also, Shinji-kun...

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, what about him?

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What's wrong?

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
No, it's nothing.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, if it's nothing, that's fine.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Well, I'll wait for you patiently.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, I'll get ready for tomorrow's business trip.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I see.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Is there anything I can help you with?

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No, it's fine.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Really?

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can do it right away.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm going to my room.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hmm.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,760
Haah..Haah..

107
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,860
You explained everything by warning about me.

108
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's a bit hard to see, but there's a lot of dust in the air.

109
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm going to clean up the dust.

110
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm going to clean up the dust.

111
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm going to clean up the dust.

112
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm going to clean up the dust.

113
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Sounds are very deep, so listen tightly.

114
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What's coming left is dust.

115
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What's coming left is dust.

116
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What's following right is dust.

117
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What's following right is dust.

118
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Wait a minute

119
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,860
What's wrong?

120
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:07,860
Wait a minute.

121
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:17,860
You always come to touch my underwear, don't you?

122
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:30,860
I'll keep it a secret from my father.

123
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,860
It's okay.

124
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:45,860
I don't care if you tell me.

125
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:55,860
Say something.

126
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:16,860
What should I do?

127
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:38,860
I'm home.

128
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,860
Be careful.

129
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:49,860
I'll do my best.

130
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,860
I'm going.

131
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,860
Be careful.

132
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,860
I'll call you when I'm calm.

133
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,860
I'm going.

134
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:41,860
What's wrong?

135
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,860
You're in a hurry.

136
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,860
It's a big luggage.

137
00:15:51,860 --> 00:16:03,860
Where are you going with such a big luggage?

138
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:10,860
I don't know if you don't tell me.

139
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:19,860
Are you going somewhere?

140
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,860
Where are you going?

141
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:33,860
Don't you want to be with me?

142
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,860
Wait a minute.

143
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:43,860
Are you going out of the house?

144
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:50,860
Really?

145
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,860
I don't know if you don't tell me.

146
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,860
Let's talk.

147
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,860
Wait a minute.

148
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,860
Why don't you tell me?

149
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,860
Are you really going out?

150
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:19,860
I haven't told you anything yet.

151
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,860
Wait a minute.

152
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,860
Do you hate me so much?

153
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,860
I don't care.

154
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,860
Wait a minute.

155
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,860
I don't care.

156
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,860
Wait a minute.

157
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,860
Shut up.

158
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,860
Don't make fun of me.

159
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:58,860
You're younger than me.

160
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,860
You're up to something.

161
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,860
I'm not.

162
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,860
You're always nervous.

163
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:21,860
I'm not.

164
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,860
Do you think it's disgusting?

165
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,860
I can't live with you.

166
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,860
I'm fine.

167
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,860
I'm fine.

168
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,860
I can't.

169
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,860
Don't hug me.

170
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,860
Don't go.

171
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,860
Don't hug me.

172
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,860
Don't go.

173
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,860
Don't go.

174
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,860
I don't want to.

175
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,860
Don't go.

176
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,860
Don't go.

177
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,860
I have to talk to you.

178
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,860
Don't go.

179
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:14,860
Don't touch me.

180
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,860
Don't you care about me?

181
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,860
Don't go.

182
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:35,860
Don't go.

183
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:49,860
You've been worried about me, haven't you?

184
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,860
I'm fine.

185
00:19:53,860 --> 00:20:10,860
I can't.

186
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,860
Do you feel good?

187
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:26,860
Shut up.

188
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,860
You can touch me as much as you want.

189
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:37,860
Shut up.

190
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:55,860
What's going on?

191
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:06,860
Come here.

192
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:15,860
What do you think?

193
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:21,860
You can touch me as much as you want.

194
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:28,860
Don't move.

195
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:37,860
I'm fine.

196
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:47,860
You like me, don't you?

197
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,860
What are you doing?

198
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,860
You're worried about me, aren't you?

199
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,860
I'm not worried about you.

200
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,860
What are you doing?

201
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,860
Stop it.

202
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,860
I'm fine.

203
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:08,860
Stop it.

204
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,860
You're getting bigger.

205
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,860
No.

206
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,860
Leave it to me.

207
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,860
Stop it.

208
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,860
What are you doing?

209
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,860
I'm fine.

210
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:33,860
Stop it.

211
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,860
You're getting bigger.

212
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,860
No.

213
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,860
Don't touch me.

214
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,860
You're excited, aren't you?

215
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,860
No.

216
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
Leave it to me.

217
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,860
No.

218
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:02,860
No.

219
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:14,860
Leave it to me.

220
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,860
Stop it.

221
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,860
You're excited, aren't you?

222
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,860
No.

223
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,860
Stop it.

224
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,860
Leave it to me.

225
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,860
I'm fine.

226
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:42,860
No.

227
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,860
What are you doing?

228
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,860
I'll comfort you.

229
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,860
What are you doing?

230
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,860
Do you feel good?

231
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,860
Stop it.

232
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:15,860
I'm fine.

233
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,860
I'm fine.

234
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,860
It's not good.

235
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,860
Leave it to me.

236
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:30,860
Stop it.

237
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:53,860
It's not good.

238
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,860
You can feel better.

239
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:19,860
What are you doing?

240
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,860
Can I do this to you?

241
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:29,860
I want to get along with you.

242
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,860
I'm fine.

243
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,860
It's not good.

244
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:50,860
It's not good.

245
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:56,860
Stop it.

246
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,860
Do you want to use this?

247
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:08,860
Yes.

248
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,860
What's this?

249
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,860
You're getting bigger.

250
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:22,860
Wait a minute.

251
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,860
How do you feel?

252
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,860
Do you feel good?

253
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:36,860
No.

254
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:58,860
You're getting bigger.

255
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,860
Do you feel good?

256
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,860
Don't touch me.

257
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,860
Why?

258
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,860
You're getting bigger because you feel good, right?

259
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,860
No.

260
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:28,860
Wait a minute.

261
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:47,860
You're getting bigger.

262
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,860
I want to get along with you.

263
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,860
I want to get along with you.

264
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,860
It's not good.

265
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,860
It's not good.

266
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,860
You don't have to worry about it.

267
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,860
You can feel better.

268
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,860
Don't move.

269
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:20,860
I can't feel better.

270
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,860
It's not good.

271
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,860
Do you feel good?

272
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,860
No.

273
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,860
Stop it.

274
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,860
I'll massage you.

275
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:41,860
Don't do that.

276
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,860
It's not good.

277
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,860
Wait a minute.

278
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,860
Why?

279
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,860
What are you doing?

280
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,860
It's not good.

281
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:15,860
You don't have to worry about it.

282
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,860
Wait a minute.

283
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,860
It's not good.

284
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,860
Stop it.

285
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:51,860
It's hot.

286
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:57,860
Are you listening to me?

287
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,860
I told you to stop.

288
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,860
You feel good, right?

289
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:20,860
No.

290
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:34,860
Wait a minute.

291
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,860
It's hot.

292
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:49,860
It's not good.

293
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,860
Stop it.

294
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:01,860
You feel good, right?

295
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,860
Don't move.

296
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,860
It's not good.

297
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:19,860
It's hot.

298
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,860
Let me go.

299
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:26,860
It's not good.

300
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,860
Stop it.

301
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:50,860
It's hot.

302
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:59,860
You have a lot of blood.

303
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,860
What are you doing?

304
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,860
I'll clean your wound.

305
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,860
Stop it.

306
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
Let me go.

307
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,860
Stop it.

308
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,860
Stop it.

309
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:20,860
It's not good.

310
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:27,860
It's clean now.

311
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:33,860
Did you feel good?

312
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,860
It's hot.

313
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,860
You have a lot of blood.

314
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:45,860
Stop it.

315
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:52,860
Hide it.

316
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:58,860
Put on your shoes.

317
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,860
I haven't told you yet.

318
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,860
Let's talk.

319
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:13,860
Okay?

320
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:22,860
Please.

321
00:33:33,860 --> 00:34:02,860
It's hot.

322
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:10,860
I'm sorry.

323
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,860
I'm sorry, too.

324
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:25,860
I met your father through an app.

325
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,860
App?

326
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,860
Why?

327
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,860
You're lying, aren't you?

328
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:37,860
No, I'm not.

329
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:45,860
I met him through an app.

330
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,860
I don't know yet.

331
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:56,860
I want you to believe me.

332
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:11,860
I'm not cheating on you.

333
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:17,860
Please tell me what I can do for you.

334
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,860
I don't have anything.

335
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:26,860
I can't live with you anymore.

336
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:33,860
I'll keep it a secret.

337
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:38,860
We haven't talked for two months.

338
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,860
It's not enough.

339
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:48,860
Don't say that.

340
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,860
I want you to spoil me more.

341
00:35:51,860 --> 00:36:07,860
I don't care.

342
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:14,860
What are you doing?

343
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,860
Don't do that.

344
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,860
Why?

345
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,860
It's strange.

346
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,860
I don't care.

347
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,860
It's not good.

348
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:31,860
Why do you have to do that?

349
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,860
I don't care.

350
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:46,860
Wait.

351
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,860
You don't have to take it off.

352
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,860
I don't care.

353
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,860
It's not good.

354
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,860
Come here.

355
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,860
I don't care.

356
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,860
Come here.

357
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:16,860
I don't care.

358
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,860
It's hot.

359
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:26,860
It's okay.

360
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,860
Do you like my boobs?

361
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,860
Yes.

362
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:14,860
It's hot.

363
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:36,860
It's hot.

364
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,860
It's hot.

365
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:16,860
It's hot.

366
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,860
You can do whatever you want.

367
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,860
I can't say that.

368
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,860
Do you like it?

369
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,860
Do you feel good?

370
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:28,860
Touch me a lot.

371
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,860
I don't want you to say that.

372
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:53,860
I'm happy when you say that.

373
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,860
Does it feel good?

374
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:20,860
Does it feel good?

375
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,860
You can eat it.

376
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:40,860
I don't want to eat it.

377
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:49,860
Your face is full of it.

378
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
Do you like my boobs?

379
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,860
I don't want you to say that.

380
00:41:53,860 --> 00:42:13,860
I'm happy when you say that.

381
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:27,860
Does it feel good?

382
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:51,860

Really?

687
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,340
What did you talk about?

688
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:28,340
It's just a morning greeting.

689

Shinji is a good guy, isn't he?

693
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,340
He's a good guy.

694
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:42,340
That's right.

695
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,340
He's a funny guy.

Are you all right?

701

I'm fine.

702
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,340
Are you sick?

703
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:07,340
Are you sick?

704
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:11,340
I'm fine.

705
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:14,340
Don't push yourself too hard. Take some medicine.

706
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:18,340
I'm fine.

707
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:21,340
You don't look well.

708
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:25,340
Is that so?

709
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:31,340
You've been working hard for Shinji and me for the past two months.

710
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:35,340
That's right.

711
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:37,340
You might be tired.

712
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:43,340
Take some medicine.

713
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,340
Take a break.

714
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:49,340
That's right.

715
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:54,340
I'll take a break.

716
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:00,340
I'll be back by noon tomorrow.

717
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,340
I see.

718
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,340
Take care of Shinji.

719
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,340
I'll be waiting for you.

720
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:10,340
All right.

See you.

722
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,340

Drink a lot.

Do you want me to lick your hand?

740
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:57,340
It feels so good.

Say cheese?

774
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,900
Chomp!

775
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,900
Oh...

776
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:20,900
Ahhhh!

Go, go, go!

845
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:42,420
Go, go, go!

846
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:01,420

You did your best

863
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:05,420
What's wrong?

864
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:09,420
Can I sleep with you tonight?

865
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:13,420
Okay

866
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:42,420
Good night

867
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:13,420
Sorry, I was sleeping

868
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:17,420
You were sleeping soundly

869
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:29,420
Dad will come back tomorrow, right?

870
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:32,420
Yes, he will

871
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:37,420
I won't do things like today anymore

872
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:41,420
Can you keep it a secret from dad?

873
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:48,420
Okay

874
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:54,420
I won't bother you anymore

875
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:58,420
I'll look for a job and live alone

876
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:01,420
What?

877
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:08,420
I want to live with you, dad and Sunny

878
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:11,420
No, you can't

879
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:16,420
It's okay, I'll keep it a secret

880
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:20,420
Then we can be together

881
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:23,420
No, you're being too sweet

882
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:26,420
Really?

883
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:29,420
No, you can't

884
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:32,420
I don't think so

885
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:36,420
I want to be with you

886
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:43,420
But

887
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:49,420
It's impossible to live alone right away

888
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:55,420
I'll treat you as my mom

889
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:59,420
Can I be your mom?

890
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:02,420
No, you can't

891
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:05,420
Really?

892
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:09,420
I'm sorry for bothering you

893
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:12,420
What are you talking about?

894
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:17,420
You can bother me a lot from now on

895
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:20,420
I can't bother you anymore

896
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:23,420
No, you can bother me a lot

897
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:25,420
Look at me

898
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:28,420
It's okay

899
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:31,420
It's okay

900
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:34,420
I said I can't bother you anymore

901
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:37,420
Why?

902
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:42,420
Don't you want to touch mom's boobs?

903
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:46,420
No, I don't

904
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:49,420
Really?

905
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:52,420
Don't you want to touch them?

906
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:55,420
No, I don't

907
01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:58,420
You're lying

908
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:16,420
You can touch them a lot

909
01:47:19,420 --> 01:47:21,420
Okay

910
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:51,420
Okay

911
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:11,420
Can you touch them a lot?

912
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:21,420
I can't

913
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:29,420
I can't

914
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:51,420
You can touch them a lot

915
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:57,420
You can touch them a lot

916
01:48:57,420 --> 01:48:59,420
You can touch them a lot

917
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:18,420
You can touch them a lot from now on

918
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:25,420
It's a secret to dad

919
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:27,420
I said I can't bother you anymore

920
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:30,420
It's okay

921
01:49:31,420 --> 01:49:33,420
I want you to bother me

922
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:57,420
No

923
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:05,420
You're a coward

924
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:08,420
Coward?

925
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:15,420
It hurts

926
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:18,420
Do you want me to be spoiled?

927
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:28,420
It hurts

928
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:51,420
It feels good

929
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:57,420
It feels good

930
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:27,420
It feels good

931
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:31,420
Do you like it?

932
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:52,420
You're a coward

933
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:57,420
You're a coward

934
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:03,420
It feels good

935
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:14,420
It feels good

936
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:27,420
It feels good

937
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:33,420

You can touch them a lot

940
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:01,420
It feels good

941
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:07,420
It feels good

942
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:13,420

It feels good

947
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:08,420
You're amazing

948
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:14,420
I can't see your face

949
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:16,420
It feels good

950
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:25,420
It feels good

951
01:54:29,420 --> 01:54:31,420

It feels good

953
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:43,420
It feels good

954
01:54:55,420 --> 01:54:57,420
It hurts

955
01:55:01,420 --> 01:55:03,420
It hurts

956
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:34,420
It feels good

957
01:55:36,420 --> 01:55:38,420
Can you make me feel better?

958
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:56,420
It feels good

959
01:56:01,420 --> 01:56:03,420
It feels good

960

1157
02:20:36,420 --> 02:20:38,420
I can't do this

1158
02:20:40,420 --> 02:20:42,420
It feels good

1159
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:44,420
It feels good

1160
02:21:03,420 --> 02:21:05,420

It feels good now

1167
02:22:21,420 --> 02:22:23,420
It feels good

1168
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:29,420

1177
02:23:49,420 --> 02:23:51,420
You put your head on my chest

1178
02:23:53,420 --> 02:23:55,420
You put your head on my chest?

1179
02:23:59,420 --> 02:24:01,420
I'm so happy

1180
02:24:02,420 --> 02:24:04,420
I'm so happy

1181
02:24:16,420 --> 02:24:18,420
I'm so sticky

1182
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:20,420
I'm so sticky

1183
02:24:20,420 --> 02:24:22,420

Thank you, mom

1188
02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:55,420
You called me mom for the first time

1189
02:24:56,420 --> 02:24:58,420
I'm so happy

1190
02:25:02,420 --> 02:25:04,420
But, it's okay

1191
02:25:04,420 --> 02:25:06,420
But, it's okay

1192
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:08,420
I have to do the baby shower

1193
02:25:10,420 --> 02:25:12,420
You don't have to

1194
02:25:12,420 --> 02:25:14,420
I have to do it

1195
02:25:14,420 --> 02:25:16,420
I don't want to

1196
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:18,420
I don't want to

1197
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:20,420
I can't bother you anymore

1198
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:22,420
I can't bother you anymore

1199
02:25:22,420 --> 02:25:24,420

I'm not bothering you anymore

1202
02:25:28,420 --> 02:25:30,420
Is it okay?

1203
02:25:31,420 --> 02:25:33,420
I can't touch your breast anymore

1204
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:35,420
I can't touch your breast anymore

1205
02:25:36,420 --> 02:25:38,420
I can't help it

1206
02:25:41,420 --> 02:25:43,420
Why are you coming closer?

1207
02:25:43,420 --> 02:25:45,420
Why are you coming closer?

1208
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:50,420

It's okay

1212
02:25:57,420 --> 02:25:59,420
It's okay

1213
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:01,420
Don't say that

1214
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:03,420
Don't say that

1215
02:26:03,420 --> 02:26:05,420
Come closer

1218
02:26:31,420 --> 02:26:33,420
Why are you two together?

1219
02:26:33,420 --> 02:26:35,420
Why are you two together?

1220
02:26:35,420 --> 02:26:37,420
Why are you two together?

1221
02:26:37,420 --> 02:26:39,420
Because we're a family

1222
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:41,420
Because we're a family

1223
02:26:43,420 --> 02:26:45,420
I was waiting for you to come home

1224
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:47,420
I was waiting for you to come home

1225
02:26:47,420 --> 02:26:49,420
I see. Thank you

It went well

1229
02:26:55,420 --> 02:26:57,420
Really?

I need to cheer up

1243
02:27:33,420 --> 02:27:35,420
Don't you have a souvenir?

1250
02:27:47,420 --> 02:27:49,420
It's heavy

1251
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:51,420
It's heavy

1252
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:53,420
There are a lot of documents

1253

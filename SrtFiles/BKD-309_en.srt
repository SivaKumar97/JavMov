1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yeah, you're right.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I thought it was going to rain a little.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Are you a sunny guy?

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You're a sunny girl, aren't you?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm a rainy girl.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You're a rainy girl?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I heard you're my favorite sunny guy.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're a sunny guy.

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

22
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

24
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm glad it's sunny.

25
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's a little cold.

26
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's cold because it's in the middle of the mountain.

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I gave birth to Chosuke when I was 19 years old.

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My husband was my second senior in college.

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I grew up in a girls' high school and had never dated a man.

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
As soon as I entered college, I fell in love with my husband, who was my second senior.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I fell in love with my husband, who was my second senior.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I didn't have the immunity to men.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I learned the joy of sex.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I spent every day with him.

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I was pregnant.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The people around us were against it, but we decided to have a baby.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That was Chosuke.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hey, there's a suspension bridge on the tourist map.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Do you want to go there?

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But I'm not good at high places.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's okay.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But I might not be able to walk.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why?

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's okay.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you're scared, I'll leave you alone.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't leave me alone.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you like high places?

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You used to be good at high places.

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I was good at high places.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
When my husband graduated from college and entered society,

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
my life changed.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Gradually, there was a difference between the two of us.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In the meantime, I was pregnant with my second child.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
My husband prioritized drinking at the company on the day of his birth.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I decided to get a divorce.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The newborn baby was going to be adopted by my sister and her husband.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I decided to raise Chosuke as a woman.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I raised Chosuke strictly as a father.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And Chosuke grew up to be a strong child with a sense of justice.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The high school teacher said,

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's a waste not to go to college with this grade.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Chosuke became a police officer after graduating from high school.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Chosuke made his way with his own ideas.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I was proud of Chosuke who realized it.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But there was a clue.

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Chosuke, wait a minute.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's why I told you not to be afraid.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hold my hand.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm hungry.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Chosuke, let's take a commemorative photo.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Chosuke, come here.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Let's take another picture.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Chosuke, come here.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Chosuke, come here.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Chosuke, look at me.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Chosuke was a little nervous.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Chosuke, let's go back.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I was worried about Chosuke.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So I invited Chosuke on a trip.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But Chosuke couldn't see Chosuke's girlfriend or his girlfriend's shadow.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And one more thing.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Chosuke, don't you go on a trip with your friends?

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, I don't.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
When I go on a trip with my friends,

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I need a delivery service outside the prefecture.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I see.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's hard.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Did you get a delivery service this time?

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No, I didn't.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
When I asked a friend who lives far away,

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
he said,

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I can't be found out, so I'll go by bus.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I see.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's hard to get a delivery service every time.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But it's hard.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's bad if something happens.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So I don't go on a trip on my day off.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I see.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
If you have a girlfriend,

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I think you'll go on a trip.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't have a girlfriend.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's time to check in at the inn.

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Shall we go?

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's a beautiful room.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's spacious.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I think so, too.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's good.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm tired.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I think so, too.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What's this?

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, it's tea.

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's make tea.

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm thirsty.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'll make it for you.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Thank you.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's done.

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Thank you.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Thank you.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's hot.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's warm.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It was cold outside.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's cold.

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But it's warm.

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's a Japanese-style room, so it's calm.

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's good.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I like Japanese-style rooms.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is that so?

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's cold.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's calm.

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sleepy.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Can I sleep a little?

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's okay.

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll take a break.

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm tired.

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sleepy.

137
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Another worry was the prank I did when I was sleeping.

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It was only once, but Chosuke touched my sleeping body.

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I was surprised and confused, so I pretended to sleep without knowing what to do.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Just before Chosuke entered the dormitory of the police school.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It was the last night with Chosuke as a parent and child.

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sleepy.

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sleepy.

144
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sleepy.

145
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm sleepy.

146
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm sleepy.

147
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sleepy.

148
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sleepy.

149
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sleepy.

150
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm sleepy.

151
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm sleepy.

152
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm sleepy.

153
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sleepy.

154
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sleepy.

155
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm sleepy.

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm sleepy.

157
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm sleepy.

158
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm sleepy.

159
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm sleepy.

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm sleepy.

161
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm sleepy.

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sleepy.

163
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm sleepy.

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sleepy.

165
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's night now.

166
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm sleepy.

167
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sleepy.

168
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sleepy.

169
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

170
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

171
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

172
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

173
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

174
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

175
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

176
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

177
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

178
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

179
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

180
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

181
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

182
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

183
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

184
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

185

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

216
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

217
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

218
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

219
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

243
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

244
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

245
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

246
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

247
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

248
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

249
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

250
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

251
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

252
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

253
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

254
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

255
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Wait a minute.

256
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Wait a minute.

257
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Chosuke.

258
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Are you awake?

259
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Of course I'm awake.

260
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If you do this.

261
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I can't sleep.

262
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Terrible.

263
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I was pretending to sleep.

264
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Which is worse?

265
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Why are you doing this?

266
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Because I love my mother.

267
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I couldn't stand it.

268
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Since I was a kid.

269
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I loved my young and beautiful mother.

270
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I loved her.

271
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
No way.

272
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We are parents.

273
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I know.

274
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I know.

275
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So I was trying to suppress this feeling.

276
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I've been holding it in.

277
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So.

278
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I've never come back since I joined the police.

279
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But.

280
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I was looking at my sleeping mother.

281
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I couldn't stand it.

282
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So.

283
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But.

284
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's okay if it's not like that, right?

285
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's not what I mean.

286
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Because.

287
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You were awake.

288
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You were accepting it.

289
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's not what I mean.

290
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Mother.

291
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No.

292
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
No.

293
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You were accepting it.

294
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Mother.

295
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I want to see your underwear.

296
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No.

297
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
No.

298
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Wait a minute.

299
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Wait a minute.

300
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Stop it.

301
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I won't hide it.

302
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Show me more.

303
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But.

304
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Wait a minute.

305
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's enough.

306
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Stop it.

307
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Stop it.

308
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I can't stand it.

309
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Look.

310
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Mother.

311
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Stop it.

312
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'll take a closer look.

313
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Stop it.

314
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Look.

315
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
When you were little.

316
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I told you to take a bath.

317
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Stop it.

318
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Stop it.

319
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Just a little more.

320
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Just a little more.

321
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Stop it.

322
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Just a little more.

323
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Look.

324
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Mother's nipples are like this.

325
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Look.

326
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Stop it.

327
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Mother.

328
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Do you like here?

329
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Look.

330
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Look.

331
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Stop it.

332
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Wait a minute.

333
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Mother's nipples are delicious.

334
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Stop it.

335
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Stop it.

336
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's enough.

337
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Stop it.

338
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Look.

339
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Stop it.

340
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Stop it.

341
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Stop it.

342
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Wait a minute.

343
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Stop it.

344
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Look.

345
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Mother's nipples are delicious.

346
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Look.

347
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Look.

348
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Look.

349
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Mother's nipples are delicious.

350
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Just a little more.

351
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Just a little more.

352
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Look.

353
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's enough.

354
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
That's enough.

355
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Stop it.

356
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Ah

357
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Hmm

358
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh, it feels good

359
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Ah

360
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Ah, it feels good

361
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Ah

362
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Ah

363
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Ah

364
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Ah

365
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Do you want more?

367
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yes, please.

368
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Your mouth feels good.

369
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Please give me more.

370
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yes, that's good.

371
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That's good.

372
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
That's good.

373
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That's good.

374
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
That's good.

375
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I can't stand it anymore.

376
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Wait a minute.

377
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Wait a minute.

378
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
What is it?

379
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I want to put it in my mouth.

380
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
No, you can't.

381
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's a drug.

382
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Please sleep here.

383
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
That's good.

384
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
That's good.

385
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I can't stand it anymore.

386
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I can't stand it anymore.

387
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
That's good.

388
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I can't stand it anymore.

389
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I can't stand it anymore.

390
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I can't stand it anymore.

391
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm going to sleep.

392
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm going to sleep.

393
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm going to sleep.

394
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I can't stand it anymore.

395
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I can't stand it anymore.

396
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I can't stand it anymore.

397
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Are you okay?

398
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Let's take a bath.

399
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Let's take a bath.

400
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
This is fun.

401
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yes, it is.

402
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Can I go in here?

403
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Go ahead.

404
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Go ahead.

405
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000

Go ahead.

Go ahead.

413
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That's good.

414
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It's been a while since we've been in the bath together.

415
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's been a while since we've been in the bath together.

416
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I wanted to be in the bath with you.

417
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I wanted to be in the bath with you.

418
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
What are you talking about?

419
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
What are you talking about?

420
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You're funny.

421
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Someone might come.

422
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Someone might come.

423
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's okay.

424
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It's okay.

425
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's okay.

426
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Someone might come.

427
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It's okay.

428
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It's okay.

429
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You don't have to worry.

430
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You don't have to worry.

431
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm fine.

432
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I'm fine.

433
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000

I love you.

442
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You're getting stronger.

443
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
A little.

444
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Are you having fun?

445
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm going to cry.

446
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
If you cry...

447
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
If you cry, it's not good.

448
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000

I want to go this way.

454
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
This way?

455
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Wait a minute.

456
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

468
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Help me.

469
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Don't look at me.

495
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000

I'm sorry.

502
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Be gentle.

503
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I don't want to.

504
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I'll give you a massage.

505
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I don't want to.

506
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I don't want to.

507
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I don't want to.

508
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I don't want to.

509
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I don't want to.

510
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000

I don't want to.

515
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I don't want to.

516
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I don't want to.

517
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It's embarrassing.

518
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't want to.

519
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I don't want to.

520
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000

I don't want to.

525
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I don't want to.

526
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I don't want to.

527
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I don't want to.

528
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I don't want to.

529
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I don't want to.

530
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Just a little?

531
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Just a little.

532
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You can't stand it.

533
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Just a little.

534
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I don't want to.

535
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I don't want to.

536
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I don't want to.

I don't want to.

538
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I don't want to.

539
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
You can't.

540
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
You can't do this in the hot spring.

541
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I don't want to.

542
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
You can't.

543
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I don't want to.

544
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I don't want to.

545
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I don't want to.

546
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't want to.

547
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It's a hot spring.

548
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
You can do this.

549
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I'm fine because there are only two of us.

550
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You're the only one.

551
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Just a little.

552
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I don't want to.

553
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I don't want to.

554
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I don't want to.

555
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I don't want to.

556
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I don't want to.

I don't want to.

560
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I don't want to.

561
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I don't want to.

562
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I don't want to.

563
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I don't want to.

564
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I don't want to.

565
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I don't want to.

566
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I don't want to.

567
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I don't want to.

568
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I don't want to.

569
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I don't want to.

570
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I'm tired of standing, so I'm going to sit here.

571
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I want you to sit here.

572
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
It's just a little bit.

573
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It's a little bit.

574
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

575
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
You like it while you sleep, don't you?

576
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Yes, I do.

577
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Over there.

578
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Over there, too.

579
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It feels good.

580
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Does it feel good?

581
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Yes, it does.

582
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It's warm.

583
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Does it feel good?

584
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Yes, it does.

585
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It's warm.

586
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It's amazing.

587
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It's warm.

588
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
It feels good.

589
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It's warm.

590
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It's warm.

591
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It's warm.

592
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It's warm.

593
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
It's warm.

594
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
It's warm.

595
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It's warm.

596
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
It's warm.

597
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It's warm.

598
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
It's warm.

599
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It's hard to take off your clothes, isn't it?

600
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Yes, it is.

601
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But it feels good.

602
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It feels good.

603
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It's hard to take off your clothes, isn't it?

604
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's hard to take off your clothes, isn't it?

605
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
You're a troublesome boy.

606
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It feels good.

607
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Does it feel good?

608
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Yes, it does.

609
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It's warm.

610
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It's warm.

611
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
It's warm.

612
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It's warm.

613
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Do you want to take a bath here?

614
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Do you want to take a bath here?

615
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
There is no one here.

616
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
There is no one here.

617
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
This is a hot spring.

618
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
There is no one here.

619
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
There is no one here.

620
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
It's a little hot here, too.

621
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It's a little hot here, too.

622
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
But...

623
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Please bear with me.

624
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Please bear with me.

625
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
There is no one here.

626
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
There is no one here.

627
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I can't take a bath here.

628
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I can't take a bath here.

629
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Wait.

630
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Wait.

631
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I can't take a bath here.

632
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I see.

633
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I'll just rub your body.

634
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I see.

635
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Do you understand?

636
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
If I rub your body,

637
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Do you understand?

638
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Do you understand?

639
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Yes, I understand.

640
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Yes, I understand.

641
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I can't rub your body.

642
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I don't know.

643
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I don't know.

644
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
You cannot go far.

645
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I already know that.

646
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
You already know that?

647
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
wait.

648
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Please wait.

649
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Please don't go far.

650
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
No way.

651
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Come here.

652
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I said No way.

653
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
No! No!

654
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,040
Please don't

655
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,920
Don't put your feet in it yet

656
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,280
Please don't

657
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,280
I told you that's enough

658
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,560
Really?

659
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,840
Are you a questioner?

660
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,740
I'm a questioner

661
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,240
Sorry I should have done it quickly

662
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I'm sorry.

663
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
You tried to run away, didn't you?

664
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I won't let you escape.

665
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I'm sorry.

666
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Try again.

667
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
That's it.

668
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
That's all.

669
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I'm sorry.

670
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I'm sorry.

671
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I'm sorry.

672
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I won't let you escape.

Hang in there.

681
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You're a rabbit, aren't you?

682
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Hang in there.

683
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000

01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I almost made it.

718
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Mom.

719
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Do you want me to get angry?

But I don't have much time.

751
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Someone might come.

It's been a long time since I lashed out last.

It's okay.

780
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,460
Why did you leave me?

781
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:04,460
Because I couldn't stand it.

782
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:21,460
I'm hungry.

783
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:24,460
I'm sorry, mom.

784
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,460

It's a little weak there.

Sit in front of me.

Tell me.

01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:23,460
Harder?

829
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,460
Your face?

You accept everything with your boobs.

838

Oh, it's amazing.

839
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:14,460

Hey, I want to be with my mom again.

But I don't know what will happen.

855
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:42,460
I'll love my mom for the rest of my life.

Am I the only one who is naked?

I'm nervous.

953
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:52,460
I'm nervous.

954
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:00,460
Your neck is cute.

955
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:04,460
It's hard.

956
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,460

01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:41,460
It's sensitive.

961
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:42,460
It's sensitive.

962
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,460

It's amazing.

967
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:06,460
You're hyperactive.

968
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:10,460
It's because you're licking me like that.

969
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:17,460
It's really hard.

970
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:20,460
You almost peed all over.

971
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:21,460
You almost peed all over.

972
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:22,460
You almost peed all over.

973
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:28,460
Ah, it came out.

974
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:30,460
It's difficult, mom.

975
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:32,460
Hide it.

976
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:42,460
Does it feel good?

977
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:48,460
Wait.

978
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:56,460
You are amazing. You are energetic.

You are amazing.

982
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:21,460
You are not supposed to do that on my panties.

983
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:23,460
I'm going to hide it.

984
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:25,460
No, that's...

985
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:38,460
It looks like it's going to break.

986
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,460
Are you going to take it out from here?

987
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:57,460
Boys take it out from here, right?

988
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:08,460
It feels good, mom.

989
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:27,460

996
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:55,460
Mom, can I lie down here?

997
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:57,460
Of course.

998
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:00,460
Look at me.

999
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:06,460
You are amazing.

1000
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:09,460
I want to show it to you.

1001
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:10,460
I can see it well.

1002
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:11,460
Can you see it?

1003
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:12,460

01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:56,460
Do you feel good?

1134
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:08,460
It's hard.

1135
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:14,460
It's hard.

1136
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:22,460
You love me, don't you?

1137
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:24,460
I love you, mom.

1138
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:26,460
I'll do my best.

1139
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:28,460
You can do it.

1140
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:36,460
I feel good.

1141
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:44,460
I feel good.

1142
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:54,460
I feel good.

1143
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,460
I feel good.

1144
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:00,460
I feel good.

1145
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,460
Do you feel good?

1146
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:20,460
It's hard, isn't it?

1147
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:30,460
It's hard, isn't it?

1148
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:32,460
It's hard, isn't it?

1149
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:38,460
Can you see it?

1150
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:50,460
I can't hold it.

1151
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:52,460
I can't hold it.

1152
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:58,460
I can't hold it.

1153
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:16,460
I feel good.

1154
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:18,460
I feel good.

1155
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:22,460
It's hard.

1156
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:26,460
It's hard.

1157
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:28,460
It's hard.

1158
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:30,460
It's hard.

1159
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:50,460
It's hard.

1160
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:52,460
It's hard.

1161
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:58,460
Do your best next time.

1162
01:47:58,460 --> 01:48:00,460
Do your best next time.

1163
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:02,460
I can do it, mom.

1164
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:16,460
It's hard.

1165
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:18,460
It's hard.

1166
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:22,460
It's hard.

1167
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:24,460
You're moving by yourself.

1168
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:26,460
I'm moving, aren't I?

1169
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:28,460
I feel good.

1170
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:40,460
I feel good.

1171
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:42,460
I feel good.

1172
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:52,460
It's hard.

1173

Do your best.

1176
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:14,460
Do your best.

1177
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:16,460
It's hard.

1178
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:18,460
It's hard.

1179
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:20,460
It's hard.

1180
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:34,460
It's hard, isn't it?

1181
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:46,460
It's hard.

1182
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:16,460
It's hard.

1183
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:32,460
What do you want to do?

1184
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:34,460
What do you want to do?

1185
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:36,460
I want to hug you.

1186
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:38,460
I want to hug you.

1187
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:40,460
I'll do it.

1188
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:42,460
I'll do it.

1189
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:44,460
Come here.

1190
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:56,460
Can you see me?

1191
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:58,460
I can see you well.

1192
01:50:58,460 --> 01:51:00,460
It's amazing, isn't it?

1193
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:04,460
It's amazing.

1194
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:06,460
It's amazing.

1195
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:08,460
I'm so surprised.

1196
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:10,460
It's amazing.

1197
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:12,460
I'm so surprised.

1198
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:14,460
Do you want to follow me?

1199
01:51:16,460 --> 01:51:18,460
Move your body.

1200
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:20,460
Good job.

1201
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:22,460
Good job.

1202
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:24,460
You can do it, right?

1203
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:26,460
You can do it slowly.

1204
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:28,460
Good job.

1205
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:30,460
It feels good, doesn't it?

1206
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:32,460
It feels good, doesn't it?

1207
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:36,460
My neck is stiff.

1208
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:38,460
My neck is stiff.

1209
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:44,460
It feels good, doesn't it?

1210
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:46,460
It feels good, doesn't it?

1211
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:02,460
It hurts.

1212
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:18,460
It's in a good place.

1213
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:20,460
It's in a good place.

1214
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:22,460
Do you understand?

1215
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:24,460
Do you understand?

1216
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:26,460
Do you remember where you feel good?

1217
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:28,460
Do you remember where you feel good?

1218
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:32,460
It's in a good place.

1219
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:34,460
It feels good, doesn't it?

1220
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:42,460
It's in a good place.

1221
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:48,460
Can you move your body?

1222
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:50,460
Can you move your body?

1223
01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:58,460
It's in a good place.

1224
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:02,460
It's in a good place.

1225
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:04,460
It's in a good place.

1226
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:06,460
More.

1227
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:10,460
More.

1228
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:28,460
Do you want to hug me?

1229
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:30,460
It's okay.

1230
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:32,460
It's okay.

1231
01:53:34,460 --> 01:53:36,460
Come here.

1232
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:38,460
It's okay.

1233
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:40,460
It's okay.

1234
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:42,460
It's okay.

1235
01:54:06,460 --> 01:54:08,460
It's in a good place.

1236
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:12,460
It's in a good place.

1237
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:30,460
It feels good.

1238
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:32,460
It feels good.

1239
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:42,460
It's in a good place.

1240
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:06,460
It's in a good place.

1241
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:08,460
It's in a good place.

1242
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:12,460
It's in a good place.

1243
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:20,460
It's very wet.

1244
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:22,460
It's very wet.

1245
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:24,460
It's very wet.

1246
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:34,460
It's amazing.

1247
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:42,460
You can do whatever you want today.

1248
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:44,460
You can do whatever you want today.

1249
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:48,460
Can I do it?

1250
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:50,460
You can do it.

1251
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:52,460
You can't do it yet.

1252
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:54,460
You can't do it yet.

1253
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:58,460
Why?

1254
01:55:58,460 --> 01:56:00,460
Because it feels good.

1255
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:08,460
It's intense.

1256
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:12,460
It's intense.

1257
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:28,460
It's a good place.

1258
01:56:30,460 --> 01:56:32,460
You can do whatever you want today.

1259
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:36,460
You can do whatever you want today.

1260
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:38,460
You can do whatever you want today.

1261
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:42,460
You can do whatever you want today.

1262
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:12,460
You can do whatever you want today.

1263
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:14,460
You can do whatever you want today.

1264
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:18,460
You can do whatever you want today.

1265
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:30,460
It feels good.

1266
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:32,460
It feels good.

1267
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:42,460
It feels good.

1268
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:02,460
I felt good, too.

1269
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:04,460
I felt good, too.

1270
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:12,460
I feel good, too.

1271
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:24,460
It's refreshing.

1272
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:26,460
It's refreshing.

1273
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:34,460
It's refreshing.

1274
01:58:40,460 --> 01:58:45,460
I'm glad I was able to take a walk in the park with my family.

1275
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:50,460
I'm glad I was able to take a walk in the park with my family.

1276
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:55,460
I'm glad I was able to take a walk in the park with my family.

1277
01:58:55,460 --> 01:59:00,460
I'm glad I was able to take a walk in the park with my family.

1278
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:05,460
I'm glad I was able to take a walk in the park with my family.

1279
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:10,460
But they watch you and run away.

1280
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:15,460
But they watch you and run away.

1281
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:20,460
I hope this lawmakers plan can be that.

1282
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:25,460
people help change Japan.

1283
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:30,460
I hope this legislators plan can be that.

1284
01:59:30,460 --> 01:59:32,460
I'd like to stay one more night.

1285
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:37,460
The police's delivery is today, right?

1286
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:39,460
I won't be found out.

1287
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:44,460
No, you're serious, right?

1288
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:46,460
That's right.

1289
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:49,460
Let's go home.

1290
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:51,460
Let's go home.

1291
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:53,460
Let's go home.

1292
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:55,460
Let's go home.

1293
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:57,460
Let's go home.

1294
01:59:58,460 --> 01:59:59,460
Let's go home.

1295
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:02,460
Let's go home and flirt.

1296
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:16,460
I don't know if this is good.

1297
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:22,460
But I've been pranked by Chosuke and pretended to sleep.

1298
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:25,460
I may have wanted this to happen.

1299
02:00:25,460 --> 02:00:32,460
From now on, I will live as Chosuke and as a man and a woman.

1300
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:59,460
Thank you for watching.

1301
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:30,460
Thank you for watching.

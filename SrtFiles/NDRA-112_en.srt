1
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,830
Oh, my dear, I can open it now.

2
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,170
thanks to

3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,260
So is it.

4
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,140
You were super surprised.

5
00:01:02,141 --> 00:01:04,080
Photographer is difficult.

6
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:06,260
Yes, but it is hard.

7
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,680
I am still a photographer.

8
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:12,560
Oh, the house of Canna, that’s where it is.

9
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,240
Oh that you?

10
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,450
Just now.

11
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,070
Hiro, come in and go in.

12
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,620
The Mom?

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,760
and yeah.

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,960
Welcome to Cannes.

15
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,180
This is the one I talked about before, Mr. Hiro.

16
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,260
Mr. Hilary, I am pleased.

17
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,180
Thank you, I am pleased.

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,720
It is a canine that I am going to meet with.

19
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,760
It is very nervous, very nervous, and it is a straight, straight, straight language.

20
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,040
I will give you a slider.

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,160
thanks to.

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,740
It is beautiful.

23
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,920
It is clean.

24
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,320
There is nothing that can overcome natural light.

25
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,460
I don’t know well, though.

26
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,560
But the view is very beautiful.

27
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,200
Where is it here?

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,600
This is the rocker that the master took me.

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,400
Yes

30
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:24,620
Small house in Chiba.

31
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:25,940
Oh yeah yeah.

32
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,720
Is he a photographer of the Maple?

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,900
No, not very bad.

34
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,580
still completely

35
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,560
The teacher called him to the scene.

36
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,160
Yes is.

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,940
It is awesome, Hiroshima.

38
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:43,560
Have a good luck.

39
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,540
That way?

40
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:45,740
Yes to?

41
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,800
About my mom?

42
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,780
Oh yes yes.

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,220
Yes, but yes

44
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,940
About her sister?

45
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,960
Not my sister, but my father.

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,200
Oh no other.

47
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,440
You mean too young.

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,780
I did not say.

49
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:22,860
Canana daddy, married again, and a new mom. so, parents, children, mother-in-law, so that is what I say.

50
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,180
More than that. — Yes.

51
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,280
It looks like a piss next.

52
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,160
Tell her beautifully, she will be very happy.

53
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,020
No, that is so.

54
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,060
Oh, you got tea in.

55
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,320
Thanks to Mom.

56
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,430
Yes please please.

57
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,170
I love cookies very much.

58
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,570
I will eat.

59
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,330
Please do a cookie.

60
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,570
Thanks to.

61
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,290
Now I say that she is beautiful to my mom.

62
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,290
Hiro, a great camera.

63
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,210
Yes to.

64
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,750
Hiro is a professional photographer.

65
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,090
It is awesome!

66
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,850
That is too much.

67
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,910
Dream of a professional photographer.

68
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,070
It is awesome.

69
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:30,650
The camera assistant.

70
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,890
What kind of camera are you typically taking?

71
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,890
Usually I take pictures of landscapes.

72
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,290
Still in training.

73
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,410
accompanying the teacher.

74
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:46,250
I will give you an assistant.

75
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,770
It is awesome.

76
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:51,950
Take pictures of people.

77
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:55,230
I thought I would have to photograph.

78
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:56,970
I am still working hard now.

79
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,210
It is awesome.

80
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,330
Yes to Mom.

See also Mom.

82
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:03,650
Before my dad married again.

83
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,630
I did the modeling work.

84
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:06,650
So is.

85
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,010
I do not.

86
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,690
Is it so? is great.

87
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,770
I no longer hate that kind of thing.

88
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,150
Okay is.

89
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,510
How about model?

90
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,970
When I was single, I asked for a job.

91
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,750
A lady dress catalogue.

92
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,850
It is awesome.

93
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,050
Well, it’s always been good style.

94
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,470
Stop for a moment.

95
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,190
Yes to you, Hiro.

96
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,550
Now try my mom’s photo.

97
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,830
Okay okay is okay?

98
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,610
I said I wanted to take a photo of someone.

99
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:46,810
Yes to.

100
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:47,790
Mom is okay, right?

101
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,790

102
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,130
Please please!

103
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,030
Is it okay?

104
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,010
Is it me?

105
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:55,890
Yes to.

106
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,610

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,130
So stay happy.

110
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,420
What to do with Pose?

111
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,700
something

112
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,500
This is?

113
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,740
I am ashamed, I know.

114
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,920
Stand up normally.

115
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,020
Oh yeah

116
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,080
This is

117
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,020
Yes, it feels good.

118
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,160
Then

119
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,940
Both are too nervous.

120
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,750
Good thing, Hiroshima

121
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:36,230
Yes

122
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,090
Is it okay?

123
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,930
Halo, I’ll give you water.

124
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,890
Mom is fine too.

125
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,010
Great but model.

126
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,590
If only this little girl.

127
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:51,590
Very cute.

128
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,050
So a little.

129
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:56,290
Turn the back.

130
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,350
Will you look back?

131
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:01,010
See also  Jade

132
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:03,590

00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:04,870
Oh, it is in this direction.

134
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,770
So I go.

135
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,390
Oh well, the hole.

136
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,370
Swept tomorrow too.

137
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:14,030
It was early in the morning to photograph.

138
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:15,750
Oh yeah yeah

139
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:16,970
Oh, look at me here.

140
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,990
If so, stay here today.

141
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,990
Oh well?

142
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:22,630
Okay is?

143
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,570
Oh, Mom, you can stay here today.

144
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,870
Hersh if you want.

145
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,550
Because he is.

146
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:31,430
Oh yeah, then

147
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,950
Can I let you speak your words?

148
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,450
Yes, of course

149
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:37,850
So, you have decided, in your head.

150
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:39,990
Maybe I got used to a little.

151
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:41,130
I remembered.

152
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,290
Can I borrow a chair?

153
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,310
Oh, of course

154
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:49,150
I will fix your fat hair.

155
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:50,610
Oh, I have gotten troubled.

156
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,170
Sit on a chair.

157
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,970
Thanks to Canna.

158
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,630
What about Peggy, sweet mom?

159
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,490
Yes, I think it is very beautiful.

160
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:07,950
Are you filming now?

161
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,970
Yes, I am filming it.

162
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:11,070
This is an obstacle, right?

163
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,230
I think you should get used to here a little.

164
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,920
So, it feels like wearing paper with your right hand.

165
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,420
I will borrow you paper.

166
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,980
Oh so cute.

167
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,580
It was a long time since I took pictures.

168
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:42,160
But it looks black.

169
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,440
You photograph from below.

170
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,570
Is it filmed?

171
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,010
It is filmed.

172
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,610
Enjoy the photo.

173
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,610
I want to see later.

174
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,150
This is great, right?

175
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,400
Yes Yes Yes Yes

176
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,420
Very beautiful.

177
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,400
Okay okay.

178
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,820
It is photographed beautifully.

179
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:28,280
Yes, it is filmed.

180
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:30,460
by

181
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:32,820
The room is not dark, Basil.

182
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:36,880
I said that natural light was good.

183
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:38,560
Yes, it is natural light.

184
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:40,820
You are very clean in now.

185
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,620
Okay okay okay okay.

186
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,880
Because model is good.

187
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:46,100
No, I no longer know.

188
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:47,080
That way?

189
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,420
If you want to take a picture later.

190
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:51,580
Oh, I am okay.

191
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,260
by  by  by

192
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,880
No, it is okay

193
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,820
It is okay, I am ashamed.

194
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,380
Oh, but you can’t take pictures with us all three.

195
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,600
Oh well okay.

196
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,620
Okay okay?

197
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,660
I wish we were all.

198
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,440
Let’s take a picture of them three.

199
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,560
So, it is for me.

200
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,300
Can you sit next to me, Mom?

201
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,060
Yes to.

202
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,480
But she is narrow.

203
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:19,900
Oh thank you.

204
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,300
well is.

205
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:22,920
well is.

206
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,440
Yes, here is

207
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,760
Oh, Kitty, Hershey is out.

208
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:28,900
True is

209
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,860
Maybe it’s better to go to the side.

210
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:35,760
See also

211
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,160
This feels good.

212
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,360
This is?

213
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,520
Are you out and not horizontally?

214
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,760
I photographed a lot.

215
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,760
I am glad.

216
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,140
I want to see soon.

217
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:53,740
No, but go on.

218
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:55,120
Send it later.

219
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:55,900
Photographed

220
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:57,120
Yes yes okay.

221
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,060
Canna is not allowed to photograph.

222
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,600
I am OK.

223
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:02,520
Okay okay

224
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:03,800
Yes, because I write.

225
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:04,600
Okay okay.

226
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,180
I still can’t photograph.

227
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:08,520
I too have been photographed a lot.

228
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:09,840
I eat cookies.

229
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,380
Oh yeah

230
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,080
Canna is so cute.

231
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:15,760
Not because she is cute.

232
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,460
Because cute.

233
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:18,360
say that.

234
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,320
It was great, you photographed it.

235
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,580
I have studied.

236
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,900
Good to be.

237
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:27,420
Show me a little.

238
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,580
greatly

239
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,580
It is photographed beautifully.

240
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,380
You are great, Mr. Hiroshima.

241
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:38,440
is good.

242
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,580
Can I take a little more picture?

243
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,240
of course

244
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:45,200
Good thing Hiroshima.

245
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:46,020
Then

246
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:50,780

00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,280
What happened?

249
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,960
I came to brush my teeth.

250
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,120
I came to brush my teeth.

251
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:42,380
Please Please Please

252
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:43,820
Come and come.

253
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:45,220
But okay is.

254
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,030
Now, just clean it up.

255
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,960
Does Hiroshima have toothbrushes?

256
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,020
Yes, it is okay.

257
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:57,340
Good was

258
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,400
Do not worry, clean it.

259
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,280
Has Cannavaro already slept?

260
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,560
He was already asleep.

261
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:40,440
really is?

262
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,520
I took a good photo today.

263
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,700
Really good.

264
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,780
I learned a lot, thank you.

265
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:11,220
Okay, was it good?

266
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,300
It was very good.

267
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:13,800

268
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,280
Is it okay? I took a picture.

269
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:19,300
I really want to see.

270
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:20,100
See you?

271
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:21,540
Yes

272
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Okay is.

273
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,560
It is awesome, it is good.

274
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,920
Not a great painting.

275
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,220
You are just trying to be professional.

276
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:36,320
Is it true?

277
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,720
greatly

278
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,940
This is nice too.

279
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:40,840
Is it?

280
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,120
Yes, it is great.

281
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,840
Is this a failure?

282
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,640
Is the camera okay with wet hands?

283
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:55,280
Okay, okay, so I’m sorry

284
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,010

Oh well

00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,800
Did you sleep well yesterday?

301
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,380
Looks to sleep.

302
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,800
Oh, and it didn’t sound?

303
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:43,100
Yes, I did not do that at all.

304
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:43,920
Good was.

305
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,460
So, go on and do your filming work.

306
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,620
Yes, I try to.

307
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:49,980
Okay, it’s time to go to school.

308
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,700
Come to me.

309
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,720
Thanks for the breakfast.

310
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,820
You are so shy, come back.

311
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,620
So let’s go over.

312
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:02,920
I will come.

313
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,940
Come to me.

314
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:05,360
Be careful of.

315
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,140
Hiroshima what happened?

316
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,310
Mom, I was talking about last night.

317
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,710
Sorry for a little.

318
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,230
Oh well okay.

319
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,550
Mom, you are mocking.

320
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,950
Hirochkin, you’re young, you’re always like that.

321
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,250
Sorry to sorry.

322
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,690
Didn’t you hurt yesterday?

323
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,990
A little bit yet.

324
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,250
It hurt?

325
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,010

326
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,190
Show me a little.

00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:13,090
No, that is

328
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,250
Because you should not get injured.

329
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:16,390
Okay to say.

330
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:17,990
See also a little.

331
00:32:17,991 --> 00:32:20,090
Oh, a little

332
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:28,080
It doesn’t seem to be injured.

333
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,450
Is it?

334
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,450
Still hurt?

335
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,010
Yes is

336
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,320
But

337
00:32:41,321 --> 00:32:42,760

338
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,200
calm a little.

339
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:51,400
calm a little.

340
00:32:51,401 --> 00:32:52,740
A little no.

341
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,820
No, if not herod.

342
00:32:54,821 --> 00:32:56,820
Sorry, I can’t stop.

343
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,880
Assistant is late.

344
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:02,960
Herodiously

345
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:04,200

Herodiously

349
00:33:11,351 --> 00:33:13,690
A little bit, calm down.

350
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,710
Herod, because it is not.

351
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,270
Hermes, wait for me.

352
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,810
I will clear it up once,

353
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,950
Do not tell Canna.

354
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,440
You are young, so sometimes.

355
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,840
Does it hurt if you touch it?

356
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,660
A little bit of you.

357
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,250
What about this?

358
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,970
It feels good.

359
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,070
greatly

360
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,750
It is great, Hiroshima.

361
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,880
Feel good

362
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,080
greatly

363
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,600
I am late, so I will clear up you soon.

364
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
Oh yes yes

365
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,880
Oh, that is it, it feels good.

366
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:47,060
Feels good?

367
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:50,700
Yes

368
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,760
Yes yes

369
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,520
Yes

370
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:57,520
Oh really

371
00:34:57,521 --> 00:34:59,780
The mouth, no

372
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,400
Feels good?

373
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,500
Feel good

374
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,040
No to.

375
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,960
Is it difficult to study the camera?

376
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,460
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

377
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,720
I get angry with my teacher every day.

378
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:23,160
Is it hard? – It is hard.

379
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,220
This evening’s camera is very white balanced.

380
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,560
What is White Balance?

381
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,460
It is a function that forgets the color.

382
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,440
Yes is it.

383
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,900
That is difficult.

384
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:46,440
This is difficult.

385
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,440
It is hard, Hiroshima.

386
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,520
Oh well awesome.

387
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,900
Do you want to sleep a little?

388
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,780
Okay okay?

389
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,220
It is hard to get late, the scene.

390
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,250
Oh awesome.

391
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,710
Does it hurt, Dr.

392
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,310
It does not hurt.

393
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,890
Great shit that.

394
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:30,210
I don’t want to photograph like this.

395
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:33,510
I want to take a white balance picture of my mom’s clothes.

396
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,450
The white balance?

397
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,270
No, not here.

398
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,710
How about white balance?

399
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:53,710
I am hungry.

400
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,080
A bit embarrassed.

401
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,260
Feel good

402
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,560
Remove it later.

403
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,530
is delicious?

404
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,040
I want to see my breasts.

405
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,840
Do you want to see your breasts?

406
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,250
How about Herod.

407
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:57,390
It is very colorful.

408
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,630
It is white, right?

409
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,310
Like a breast.

410
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:22,690
The breast?

411
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,470
Look at it, Hiroshima.

412
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,340

413
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:39,860

I am ashamed now.

415
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,260
already great

416
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,440
Do you like your breasts?

417
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:04,180
There will be a lot of white.

418
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:11,120
I love my breasts.

419
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,820
You are not happy, you cannot work.

420
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,340
No longer

422
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,190
Take a lot and relax.

It feels good.

433
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,840
I am ashamed of taking so many photos.

434
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,660
Oh yeah

435
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,220

Oh yeah

00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,900
Look at me, mother.

439
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,760
I am ashamed now.

440
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,720
Great heroes

441
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,400
Remove it later.

442
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,140
Yes is

443
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:36,030
Full of stomach.

444
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:38,330
Oh awesome.

445
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:41,390
Milosevic is awesome.

446
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,910
Oh awesome.

447
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,760
Come to me.

448
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,110
Can you concentrate on your work?

449
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,340
It is delicious!

450
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,410
No to

451
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,040

Oh yeah

453
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:14,770
I did it, I did it.

454
00:44:14,771 --> 00:44:15,550
Yes

455
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,700
I can work with this.

456
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:22,480
Yes

457
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,100
Yes

458
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,380
Yes

459
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,420
And to Canna.

460
00:44:28,421 --> 00:44:29,860
Absolutely not tell.

461
00:44:29,861 --> 00:44:31,160
Yes yes yes

462
00:44:31,161 --> 00:44:34,200
So, prepare for your work quickly.

463
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:35,540
I will be late.

464
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,510
The photographer’s phone rings.

465
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,020
The photographer’s phone rings.

466
00:45:02,021 --> 00:45:04,200
If if

467
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,240
Mr Hiroshima.

468
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,450
See, you have already come.

469
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,310
Hiro, where do you forget?

470
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:33,870
Oh, there was

471
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,210
Good to have.

472
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,930
Otherwise, I will really.

473
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,870
Thanks to.

474
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:49,370
I mean, I’m late in the circle today.

475
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:51,570
Yes is it.

476
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,450
I said there was a clutter.

477
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,670
Thank you for the last time, photos.

478
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:06,110
Thank you for taking these beautiful photos.

479
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,530
You photographed a great thing.

480
00:46:08,531 --> 00:46:12,790
True, but it is good to take pictures.

481
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:13,670
is it?

482
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:20,530
Yes, if you wear a shirt, it will feel a little better.

483
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:27,750
I am sure that you are a lot of women.

484
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,970
I tried to photograph something.

485
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:35,810
Can you please take a picture today?

486
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,350
Yes yes yes

487
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,930
Is it OK?

488
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,530
Sit there and sit there.

489
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,290
Keep your feet a little longer.

490
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:48,530
on this side.

491
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,590
This is

492
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:58,490
Okay is.

493
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:01,910
Is it okay?

494
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:03,730
Is it okay?

495
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,930
is okay.

496
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:15,910
I am glad you took pictures of me.

497
00:47:15,911 --> 00:47:16,850
Are you happy?

498
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:17,770
Yes

499
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:21,410
Raise your feet a little.

500
00:47:21,411 --> 00:47:24,070
Put your feet up on the bed.

501
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,240
Oh yes yes

502
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,280
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

503
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:31,720
Her feet are so beautiful.

00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:32,740
really is?

505
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,180
Yes is

506
00:47:34,181 --> 00:47:35,820
I am a little embarrassed.

507
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,780
A little from the foot.

508
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,160
I will try to photograph.

509
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,650
Oh, it is great.

510
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:52,530
Oh really?

511
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:11,250
I really like the camera.

512
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:14,890
Yes, I love you.

513
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,040
really is?

514
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,820
I am glad, I am so sorry to say so.

515
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,720
Good to be.

516
00:48:35,721 --> 00:48:38,940
I’ll take pictures today when I’m done.

517
00:48:38,941 --> 00:48:39,940
Oh yes yes

518
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,260
So, just turn a little back.

519
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:08,360
And behind?

520
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,960
Keep it backwards.

521
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,100
Oh so in that way.

522
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:14,920
Go to this direction.

523
00:49:14,921 --> 00:49:16,040
Yes Yes Yes

524
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,550
Oh, very good you are.

525
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,800
Hold your elbow for a while.

526
00:49:51,801 --> 00:49:52,320
The elbow?

527
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,040
How about? 😂😂😂😂

528
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:18,140
Very good.

529
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,870
Are you training properly?

530
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,590
It is becoming, it is becoming.

531
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:35,470
This corner is good.

532
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,910
Very beautiful nearby.

533
00:50:45,911 --> 00:50:49,270
I am a little embarrassed nearby.

534
00:50:49,271 --> 00:50:50,310
Are you ashamed?

535
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,080
A little bit, what did you do?

536
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,480
A bit scary.

537
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,480
A bit scary.

538
00:51:17,481 --> 00:51:17,860
A little

539
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,720
No, Mr Hiroshima

540
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:35,440
When she saw her mother, she could not bear it anymore.

541
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,780
See also Hiroshima.

542
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,780
No, not to Hiroshima.

543
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,960
My mother is too ugly.

544
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:55,320
A little, a little, a little, no.

545
00:51:55,420 --> 00:52:01,950
In this room, you know this.

546
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:04,850
So you should not find out.

547
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:11,790
A little, a little, a little, no.

548
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:19,790
Sorry very much.

549
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:23,430
My daughter’s boyfriend and that.

550
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:26,790
I will not say it.

551
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:30,850
A little

552
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:32,810
Welcome to

553
00:52:32,811 --> 00:52:37,330
No to No.

554
00:52:37,331 --> 00:52:41,270
Be a cow.

Oh is

558
00:53:00,531 --> 00:53:06,010
You have a canine already.

559
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:16,990
Your mother is more attractive.

560
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,590
Do not say that.

561
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:26,070
Stop now, good luck.

562
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,530
cannot stop.

563
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,160
mother

564
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,600
No, so that way.

565
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,660
Your mother is good.

566
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,060
No is not.

567
00:54:01,061 --> 00:54:03,060
Better to your mother.

568
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,980
No to no.

569
00:54:04,981 --> 00:54:07,840
You are dating so well.

570
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,640
But my mother is more attractive.

571
00:54:10,641 --> 00:54:13,320
So much, no

572
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,640
Very cute.

573
00:54:33,381 --> 00:54:36,280
I am going...

574
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,780
A little embarrassed.

575
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:52,160
It is so dirty, no.

576
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,480
It is not dirty, it is beautiful.

577
00:54:56,481 --> 00:54:58,280
He is sweating.

578
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,720
Are you ashamed?

579
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,340
No to

580
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:03,660
No is no.

581
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,280
Do not be so good.

582
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,160
Oh is

583
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,320
If I had, I would have felt better.

584
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,500
Yes, but

585
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,940
Very closed.

586
00:55:13,941 --> 00:55:15,820
No, a little

587
00:55:15,821 --> 00:55:18,280
Do not say that.

588
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:20,740
Oh is

589
00:55:20,741 --> 00:55:20,980

A little, that

594
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:36,190
In the room of Cannes, this is not possible.

595
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:40,710
Welcome to

596
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,810
No to no.

No to that.

599
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,350
It will feel better.

600
00:56:19,351 --> 00:56:21,050
OK is.

601
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:24,010
It will feel better.

602
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:30,170
If this is okay, then.

603
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:49,770
This is what happens.

604
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:51,130
Shamefully

605
00:56:51,131 --> 00:56:51,910
Welcome to

No so no.

610
00:57:37,461 --> 00:57:38,880
Finger in it.

611
00:57:38,881 --> 00:57:40,380
He was immediately in.

612
00:57:40,381 --> 00:57:41,280
Why Why?

613
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,560
No, that is

614
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:44,960
Yes

615
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,910
It is not shameless.

616
00:57:51,911 --> 00:57:52,370
No to?

617
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:09,080
Oh, he came out very well.

618
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,260
Something I am ashamed.

619
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,340
Oh well well.

620
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:27,370
Oh well well.

Oh, a little

623
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:51,410
You do not run away.

624
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:52,910
No, that is so.

625
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,980
You can not.

626
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,540
Are you not so good?

627
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:08,540
Full of feelings.

628
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:40,030
My mother, I will not replace you.

629
00:59:40,031 --> 00:59:41,530
I do not like.

630
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:52,640
I have been, and not you.

1
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:14,020
If you do this with your girlfriend, no. Oh, no.

2
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:31,280
Why do you get so much, no. No.

3
01:00:31,281 --> 01:00:31,920
Why Why?

4
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,600
Mother...

5
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:48,720
I just said...

6
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,720
It feels good...

7
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:56,280
I cannot...

8
01:00:56,281 --> 01:00:58,200
Mr. Irene, this is...

9
01:00:58,201 --> 01:01:03,300
Irene, don’t do that.

10
01:01:03,301 --> 01:01:05,520
Feeled...

11
01:01:05,521 --> 01:01:07,600

Feeled...

13
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,880
No to...

14
01:01:13,881 --> 01:01:22,560
No, I know I am saying it...

15
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:37,360
You don't remember me to like you.

16
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,020
Maybe call you more and more.

17
01:01:39,021 --> 01:01:39,040
Emblematic

18
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,460

Standing on the other side.

30
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:04,610
Herod goes away.

31
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,560
Going again.

32
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,380
Oh herodic

Herodiously

35
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,780
Herodiously

36
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,660
Feel well.

37
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:52,580
It will feel better.

38
01:02:52,581 --> 01:02:57,160
Are you hungry and feeling good?

39
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,180
The Transition

40
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:07,240
Feels good?

41
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:17,390
Feels good?

42
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:27,860
Feels good?

43

01:03:35,431 --> 01:03:38,130
Tell me?

You come in.

Shamefully

Look at it, goodbye.

117
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,560

Not to be, not to be.

Oh, so great

125
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,700
There is a lot of Hiroshi.

01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:30,520
Oh, there are a lot of these.

128
01:12:30,521 --> 01:12:31,760
Feel good

129
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:37,380
Very good feeling.

130
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,450
See also FU.

131
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:35,270
Come in and come in.

132
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:41,350
You have to wash it before you come home.

133
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:42,230
Oh yeah yeah.

134
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:46,130

135
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:51,260
Oh thank you.

136
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,820
If you do not hurry, you will come home.

137
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:19,340
Thanks to.

138
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,560
No longer at all.

139
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:26,500
Sorry to.

140
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:31,040
Yes, I just got excited.

141
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,880
Sorry for me.

142
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:40,620
I did not show my daughter’s boyfriend that way.

143
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,200
No, I really did not regret it.

144
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:51,000
No, I have to keep it secret.

145
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,880
Oh to.

146
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,880
Mr. Hiroshima is young.

147
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,740
This way, you cannot go home.

148
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,740
It is already big, Bibi.

149
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,740
I have trouble, this is.

150
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,560
A little Hiroshima.

151
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,560
Oh very hard.

152
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,960
Oh well, good bye.

153
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,840
Oh awesome.

154
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:45,160
Good luck, it’s getting hot.

155
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,140
Good luck, no

156
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:59,740
Mom, I will come home.

157
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,560
Great, I have two kids.

158
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:18,200
A little good.

159
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:23,280
greatly

160
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:25,740
Feels good?

161
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,580
Let’s go a little.

162
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:40,060
You are young anymore, no matter what.

163
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:00,920
It is awesome.

164
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:14,470
Next time I will flow.

165
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:16,650
Really thank you.

166
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:29,090
1, 2, 3, 4, and I am really a chunk.

167
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:34,050
It is... soft.

168
01:17:34,051 --> 01:17:38,590
If you feel a little better.

169
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,460
Oh no no

170
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,740
Oh no no

171
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:50,460
It hurts, it hurts.

172
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:09,460
I have become worse.

173
01:18:09,461 --> 01:18:10,740
Mr Killsy

174
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:13,920
I cannot stay home like this.

175
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:16,920
No longer

176
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:20,300
not go home.

177
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,860
No longer go home.

178
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,980
Sorry to

179
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:05,950
Just a step forward?

180
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:19,470
It is red so you can get a lot of it.

181
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:31,010
Oh yeah

182
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:34,410
Oh, there is

183
01:19:34,411 --> 01:19:36,890
This, this, this and this.

184
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:38,330
Yes

185
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,640

I will lick there too.

188
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:48,470
It feels good, not awful.

189
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,740
Very good feeling.

190
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:57,710

Heat and hard.

212
01:21:28,570 --> 01:21:29,790
Feels good?

213
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:44,970
It is great. I am very excited.

It is awesome.

223
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:19,030

You are so young and have a lot of sperm.

Hey, Hiro, you’re going to stay here today, right?

305
01:29:18,401 --> 01:29:19,500
It fits well.

306
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,040
thanks to

307
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:28,370
Very beautiful

308
01:29:28,371 --> 01:29:30,310
You found a good model.

309
01:29:30,311 --> 01:29:30,830
Yes

310
01:29:30,831 --> 01:29:33,010
No to no.

311
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,400
Press the button.

312
01:29:42,401 --> 01:29:45,440
Cannon had also taken a photo of her, right?

313
01:29:45,441 --> 01:29:49,780
But I can’t be as good as my mom.

314
01:29:49,781 --> 01:29:52,140
I want to see you, too, Canna.

315
01:29:52,141 --> 01:29:54,100
Okay okay okay okay.

316
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,060
I want to see, see.

317
01:29:57,061 --> 01:29:58,860
Oh, I am okay

318
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,600
Oh, that was good.

319
01:30:11,601 --> 01:30:12,220
really is?

320
01:30:12,221 --> 01:30:12,400
really is?

321
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,100
It feels good.

322
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:43,320
Tired of you.

323
01:30:43,321 --> 01:30:44,320
Yes is

324
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,740
From now?

325
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:53,040
Yes, but it is okay.

326
01:30:53,041 --> 01:30:54,000
Okay okay

327
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:56,900
Yes, I understand

328
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,880
About 30 minutes from now.

329
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:04,030
Yes, I understand

330
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:06,110
Yes please please.

331
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:09,340
Oh well, it is shitty.

332
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:12,920
I have a call from the office manager.

333
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:17,700
He told me to go out instead of the child who was sick.

334
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:18,900
I have to go,

335
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:23,040
It will take about 5 hours to get home.

336
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,020
I will go a little.

337
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:27,860
Be careful of.

338
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:29,360
We eat Nihil together.

339
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,480
I am waiting for Nihon.

340
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,000
I look forward to Hamburg.

341
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:35,780
So I am going.

342
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,080
Come to.

343
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,700
Be careful of.

344
01:31:53,230 --> 01:31:54,350
and nearby.

345
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:03,240
Come to.

346
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:18,840
It feels good.

347
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,500
It feels good.

348
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,480
Welcome to me, it feels good.

349
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:51,370
Touched a lot.

350
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:54,190
Even today, after all this.

351
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:58,410
I cannot endure either.

352
01:32:58,411 --> 01:32:59,410
Is it so?

353
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:02,650
Congratulations now.

354
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:05,990
The bread.

355
01:33:05,991 --> 01:33:10,050
It will wet.

356
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:15,050
Hiroshima, I have been very bad today.

357
01:33:18,870 --> 01:33:19,110
How is?

358
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:30,080
I bought a new one for Hiroshima.

359
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:34,340
Look well.

360
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:39,280
I want to take a photo of Hiroshima.

361
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:40,980
I will film immediately.

362
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:45,440
The back is awesome.

363
01:33:45,441 --> 01:33:46,160
What? what?

364
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:49,240
Oh well!

365
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:00,000
How about Hiroshima?

366
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,260
Look at a lot.

367
01:34:11,370 --> 01:34:13,030
Too much appearance.

368
01:34:18,310 --> 01:34:22,150
I would be ashamed to be so close.

369
01:34:23,870 --> 01:34:25,180
Very very beautiful.

370
01:34:44,210 --> 01:34:45,290
Very very beautiful.

371
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:47,190
Take a lot of pictures.

372
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:57,460
Hiroshima, I like this.

373
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:02,960
Hiroshima is close, scary.

374
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,480
I am excited, Hiroshima.

375
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:09,960
Would you excite?

376
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:10,460
Yes to.

377
01:35:10,461 --> 01:35:11,000
It is wasted.

378
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:14,860
It is awesome.

379
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:18,480
Look at a lot.

380
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:31,850
Are you photographed beautifully?

381
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:33,530
Yes, it is photographed very well.

382
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,120
Let’s see together.

383
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:00,940
Welcome to

384
01:36:00,941 --> 01:36:03,340
I can no longer endure.

385
01:36:15,490 --> 01:36:21,760
Feel good

386
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:28,050
Feel good

387
01:36:29,370 --> 01:36:33,090
It is awesome, it is on my shoulder.

388
01:36:36,610 --> 01:36:40,190
Feel good

389
01:36:40,191 --> 01:36:49,390
Very nice, very nice breast.

390
01:36:49,391 --> 01:36:50,810
Touched a lot.

391
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:18,710
Feel good

392
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:24,220
Smoking more.

393
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:27,320
Feel good

394
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:29,270
It feels good.

395
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,900
Feels good.

396
01:37:37,901 --> 01:37:38,880
Feel good

397
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:42,840
You are good at licking.

398
01:37:42,841 --> 01:37:45,420
It is like a breast.

399
01:37:45,421 --> 01:37:46,080
really is?

400
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,080
See also

401
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:06,010
How is?

402
01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:14,650
I am ashamed.

403
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:29,470
Oh, it has become hot.

404
01:38:29,471 --> 01:38:30,070
Has it become hot?

405
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:35,120
A little hot.

406
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:37,800
I was already very excited.

407
01:38:37,801 --> 01:38:39,040
It has become hotter.

408
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:44,340
It is great, Mr Hiroshima.

409
01:38:44,341 --> 01:38:47,620
No feel.

410
01:38:47,621 --> 01:38:49,540
Touched a lot.

411
01:38:49,541 --> 01:38:51,200
No to

412
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:53,580
that feeling

413
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:54,900
No to

414
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:56,860

415
01:38:56,861 --> 01:38:58,920

416
01:38:58,921 --> 01:39:00,620
No to

01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:03,080
No to

418
01:39:03,081 --> 01:39:04,840
The feeling tomorrow.

419
01:39:04,841 --> 01:39:06,160
No to

420
01:39:06,161 --> 01:39:08,240
No to

421
01:39:08,241 --> 01:39:12,380
that feeling

422
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:25,330
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

423
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:28,890
Go, go and go.

424
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:43,760
I was very wet.

425
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:47,580
Do you want to feel good?

426
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:50,620
I want to feel better.

427
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,520
Oh the feeling.

428
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:58,060
Show me this well.

429
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:17,600
I would be ashamed to be photographed like this.

430
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,400
Congratulations to you.

431
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:39,540
If you get something like that.

432
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:49,980
Let me pick it up yourself.

433
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:55,540
Hard to do that.

434
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:58,280
Okay, it is very wide.

435
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,400
Welcome to see.

436
01:41:05,401 --> 01:41:08,640
The feet are away.

437
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:10,900
It is wet.

438
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:16,160
It was wet.

439
01:41:16,161 --> 01:41:18,440
How about Hiroshima?

440
01:41:18,441 --> 01:41:19,460
to excite?

441
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,300
Very excited.

442
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:28,660
difficulty

443
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:34,120
Try to touch.

444
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:40,760
Yes, the ownership

445
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:46,500
Oh well feel.

446
01:41:46,501 --> 01:41:51,260
Mr. Hiro is fine.

447
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:59,400
Feels good.

448
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:05,260
High feeling.

449
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,280
It feels equally good.

450
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,980
She looks very cute.

451
01:42:10,981 --> 01:42:12,280
No to no.

452
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,580
It hurts.

453
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:17,020
No to no.

454
01:42:17,021 --> 01:42:17,580
Welcome to

455
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:20,720
Oh, and Ick

456
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:26,740

457
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:26,820
Oh is

01:42:31,101 --> 01:42:33,020
Oh, the g

459
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:34,560
Oh is

460
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:37,880
The chest is getting bigger.

461
01:42:37,881 --> 01:42:39,840
difficulty

462
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:41,600
Oh, a little

463
01:42:41,601 --> 01:42:43,400
Because I just went.

464
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,740
No to shame.

465
01:42:46,741 --> 01:42:49,300
Because I just went.

466
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:52,020
No to

467
01:42:52,021 --> 01:42:54,740
Oh feelings.

468
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:01,010
Oh feelings.

469
01:43:01,110 --> 01:43:03,330
He will go immediately.

470
01:43:06,870 --> 01:43:09,390
Oh feelings.

471
01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:11,290
No to no.

472
01:43:12,210 --> 01:43:14,580
Congratulations to Miss.

473
01:43:28,450 --> 01:43:29,410
Congratulations to Miss.

474
01:43:29,411 --> 01:43:30,950
Oh, I went away

475
01:43:30,951 --> 01:43:32,730
and goodbye.

476
01:43:32,731 --> 01:43:35,390
Feel good

477
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:38,260
Oh, and you too.

478
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:40,540
and you too.

479
01:43:40,541 --> 01:43:41,400
and there too.

480
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:50,150
Oh well great.

481
01:43:51,890 --> 01:43:52,320
Something awesome.

482
01:43:53,410 --> 01:43:56,110
I became a shit.

483
01:43:58,270 --> 01:44:02,110
Shame on me, don’t take such pictures.

484
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:07,390
I am ashamed now.

485
01:44:11,170 --> 01:44:13,330
It feels good.

486
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:20,110
I will go crazy.

487
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:24,570
power will not enter.

488
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:29,920
Feel good

489
01:44:29,921 --> 01:44:31,120
Do not go yet.

490
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:33,340
I am troubled.

491
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:35,640
Go to thee.

greatly

500
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:18,160
Feels good.

501
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,380
A little

502
01:45:21,381 --> 01:45:23,620
I just said a little.

503
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,300
Also Mr. Helsi

504
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:54,320
Oh awesome.

505
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,900
It is already hot.

506
01:45:56,901 --> 01:45:58,300
It is getting hot.

507
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:07,220
Oh awesome.

01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:10,740
It is getting hot.

509
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:24,520
Can I watch fun?

510
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:26,100
OK is.

511
01:46:45,990 --> 01:46:47,790
It feels good.

512
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:57,270
So that place?

513
01:46:57,430 --> 01:46:59,190
You can’t stand it, right?

514
01:46:59,570 --> 01:47:01,270
I cannot endure.

515
01:47:02,930 --> 01:47:03,790
Feel good

516
01:47:03,791 --> 01:47:05,370
Feels good?

517
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:15,310
My dear, you are growing up.

518
01:47:15,410 --> 01:47:17,310
Put a lot in your mouth.

519
01:47:24,190 --> 01:47:26,270
Look at me.

520
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:32,930

It feels good, sir.

538
01:48:50,421 --> 01:48:53,420
Full of stomach.

01:48:53,421 --> 01:48:53,920
That is B.

540
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:59,500
Full of stomach.

Full of stomach.

Full of stomach.

544
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:27,340
Very full of hunger.

545
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:29,300
is difficult.

546
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:36,660
Okay, you are not

547
01:49:36,661 --> 01:49:38,900
It feels good.

01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:43,320
Take your feet here too.

Take your feet here too.

I think you will do more, and it will go.

554

Good luck then.

Shame, I am taken like this.

567
01:51:31,101 --> 01:51:32,780
You like to be ashamed, right?

568
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:35,020
I will eat.

Sorry for it there.

Why do you want it?

It feels good, no.

Go a step further, one more step further.

594

It feels good.

595
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:12,040
I was photographed in Haiti.

01:54:17,690 --> 01:54:18,710
Shame to?

597
01:54:22,510 --> 01:54:23,210
What about now?

01:54:23,910 --> 01:54:25,870
Shame nearby.

601
01:54:49,581 --> 01:54:52,140
A little bit.

602
01:54:52,141 --> 01:54:55,060
Similar to

603
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:57,860

Next I will ride up.

605
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:04,730
Ride up.

01:56:25,081 --> 01:56:27,260
Finish another one.

Feel badly

649
01:59:37,951 --> 01:59:40,470

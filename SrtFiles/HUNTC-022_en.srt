1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm home.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm home.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why does he refuse me?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I wanted to do it.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I gave him a sign to let me do it.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But he didn't notice it.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I want to do it.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I want to do it.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Is there anyone here?

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm home.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Welcome back.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What is it?

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Did you just get home?

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What are you doing here late at night?

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Are you getting tired?

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No, I'm not tired at all.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You are a good girl.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But, you should go out only at night.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I understand.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Shuji is your brother, right?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You should be aware of him, and consider your father.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I really can understand him, and I don't want to be a careless daughter.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And next thing is,

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Shuji is studying hard for his entrance exam.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're going to college, too.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why don't you give him a day off?

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Me?

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's right.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He has a younger brother.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm listening.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, my.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What about you, Shuji?

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm not at home, so I can't say that.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Shuji is going to school now.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He's studying until late at night.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Wait, wait.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That means you can do it right at home when you want to do it.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's great.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I understand. I'll talk to him later.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Are you listening to me?

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes, I am.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is Shuji home yet?

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I want to do it as soon as possible.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He's back.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm home.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What are you doing?

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What's wrong?

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What's wrong?

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Something's wrong.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm just kissing you.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But we're brothers.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We're not connected.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I can't do it.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want to do it when I want to do it.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What's wrong with you, Shuji?

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You've grown up so much.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're excited because you can't do it.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Because I don't have a car.

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Is that so?

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're so cute.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm scared.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's okay.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I just kissed you.

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I can't do it.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't hide it.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm taking a bath now, so don't make a loud noise.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't hide it.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're standing up.

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Did you kill him?

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm scared.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm scared.

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm scared.

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm scared.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm scared.

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I should have noticed earlier.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm scared.

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm scared.

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm scared.

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm scared.

82
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm scared.

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't let it out.

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If you let it out, you can't do it.

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can't do it.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm scared.

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm scared.

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I have to do it.

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What?

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Of course you have to do it.

91
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm scared.

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If you don't talk, Dad won't know you're here.

93
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry, I have to go to bed.

94
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's okay, you don't have time for that.

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't have time for that.

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's okay.

97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm going to sleep.

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It tickles.

99
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It tickles.

100
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It tickles.

101
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It tickles.

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm going to sleep.

103
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't tell if you speak out loud.

104
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm going to sleep.

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You can't.

106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm going to sleep.

107
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm going to sleep.

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It tickles.

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I wanted to do it today.

110
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What?

112
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Why?

113
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It tickles.

114
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Did you want to say it?

115
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You can't say it right away.

116
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What did I do?

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm not satisfied.

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It tickles.

119
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Why are you so close to me?

120
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It tickles.

121
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It tickles.

122
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It tickles.

123
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It tickles.

124
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm so excited that my body is wet.

125
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It tickles.

126
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Does it tickle?

127
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It tickles.

128
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm going to sleep.

129
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm going to sleep.

130
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You can't.

131
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You can't speak out loud.

132
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm going to sleep.

133
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You did it, didn't you?

134
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm going to sleep.

135
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Hang in there a little longer.

136
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If you do it a little longer, I'll feel bad.

137
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It tickles.

138
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You can't.

139
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You can't speak out loud.

140
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It tickles.

141
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It tickles.

142
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You've been sleeping all the time.

143
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm going to sleep.

144
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm going to sleep.

145
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I feel good.

146
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You feel good.

147
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm in trouble.

148
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I feel good.

149
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I can't believe I was hiding this.

150
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It tickles.

151
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What?

152
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm in trouble.

153
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Wait a minute.

154
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I can't.

155
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm going to sleep.

156
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm going to sleep.

157
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Then you can speak out loud.

158
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm going to sleep.

159
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm going to sleep.

160
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can't.

161
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I can't.

162
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I can't.

163
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I can't.

164
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I can't.

165
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I can't.

166
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You slept a lot.

167
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm in trouble.

168
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't worry.

169
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You can do a lot every day from now on.

170
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Every day?

171
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm looking forward to it.

172
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I feel good.

173
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm in trouble.

174
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What's going to happen?

175
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm in trouble.

176
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm in trouble.

177
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm in trouble.

178
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You're going to the bathroom, aren't you?

179
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm in trouble.

180
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You're going to the bathroom, aren't you?

181
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm in trouble.

182
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You have to take off your pants.

183
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm in trouble.

184
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What are you doing?

185
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm in trouble.

186
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Why are you standing up?

187
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's morning.

188
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're standing up because it's morning.

189
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You can pee.

190
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I can't.

191
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Why?

192
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If you don't, I'll do it.

193
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What do you mean?

194
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Wait a minute.

195
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I can't.

196
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If you want to go to the bathroom, do it.

197
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I just wanted to have sex.

198
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If you want to go to the bathroom, do it.

199
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I can't.

200
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I can't.

201
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It feels good here, doesn't it?

202
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Wait a minute.

203
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What's going on?

204
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Do you want to touch me?

205
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I can't.

206
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It feels good.

207
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Do you like my boobs?

208
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I like them.

209
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
If you touch my boobs, they'll get hard again.

210
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It feels good.

211
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It feels good.

212
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It feels good here.

213
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's the best in the morning.

214
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I can't.

215
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What's going on?

216
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Are you going to go to the bathroom?

217
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I can't.

218
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I can't go to the bathroom yet.

219
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's too hard.

220
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's hard, isn't it?

221
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I can't.

222
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I can't go to the bathroom yet.

223
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You said you couldn't go to the bathroom until I said you could.

224
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It feels good.

225
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It feels good.

226
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I can't.

227
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

228
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
All right.

229
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Can you go to the bathroom like this?

230
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Do you want to stand up?

231
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Come here.

232
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You can go to the bathroom like this.

233
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I can't go to the bathroom yet.

234
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It smells good.

235
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It feels good.

236
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's the best in the morning.

237
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's the best in the morning.

238
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I can't.

239
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I can't.

240
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I can't.

241
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I can't.

242
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I can't move.

243
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I can't.

244
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I can't.

245
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's the best.

246
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I can't.

247
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I can't.

248
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I can't.

249
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I can't.

250
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I can't.

251
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I can't.

252
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I can't.

253
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I can't.

254
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I can't.

255
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I can't.

256
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I can't.

257
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I can't.

258
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I can't.

259
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It feels good.

260
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You did a great job in the morning.

261
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Thank you.

262
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm relieved.

263
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You can go to the bathroom.

264
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Thank you.

265
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm relieved.

266
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's the best in the morning.

267
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I woke up.

268
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It was just dawn.

269
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's just dawn.

270
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You're fine.

271
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
8.5 degrees...

272
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Good boy. Were you studying?

273
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
What are you doing?

274
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What are you doing?

275
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Wait a minute.

276
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Don't move.

277
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You were studying, weren't you?

278
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I can't study.

279
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm doing it on my own.

280
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I can't do it.

281
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Shunji.

282
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You're an examiner.

283
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You have to study properly.

284
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I have to study.

285
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You were using this?

286
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yes.

287
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
This and...

288
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Thank you.

289
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I can't concentrate at all.

290
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm doing it on my own.

291
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You have to study properly.

292
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I can't concentrate.

293
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Concentrate properly.

294
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I can't concentrate.

295
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You have to concentrate.

296
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I can't do it.

297
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I can't do it at all.

298
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You have a good reaction.

299
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I can't concentrate.

300
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's okay.

301
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Studying is important.

302
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I can't do it.

303
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You have a good reaction.

304
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I can't do it.

305
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Are you ready?

306
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You're ready, right?

307
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Of course.

308
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I came here because I wanted to see you.

309
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I can't do it.

310
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
How do you feel?

311
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I can't do it.

312
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I can't do it.

313
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I can't do it.

314
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I can't do it.

315
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I can't do it.

316
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Look at me.

317
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I can't do it.

318
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It feels good.

319
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I can't do it.

320
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I can't do it.

321
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You were excited when you touched my boobs.

322
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I can't do it.

323
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I can't do it.

324
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I can't do it.

325
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I can't do it.

326
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I can't do it.

327
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I can't do it.

328
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I can't do it.

329
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I can't do it.

330
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I can't do it.

331
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
What's wrong?

332
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I can't do it.

333
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm not satisfied yet.

334
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It feels so good.

335
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You can do it if you're so excited.

336
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
One more time?

337
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Let's do it again.

338
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Come here.

339
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I want to touch you.

340
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You can lick me if you want.

341
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I can't do it.

342
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You're wet.

343
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I can't do it.

344
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I can't do it.

345
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You're so excited that you can't do it.

346
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Let me touch you.

347
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It feels so good.

348
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's hot, isn't it?

349
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's hot.

350
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It's hot.

351
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It feels so good.

352
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It feels so good.

353
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I can't do it.

354
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I can't do it.

355
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Are you okay?

356
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I was trying to do it.

357
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It feels so good.

358
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You're licking me.

359
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I can't do it.

360
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I can't do it.

361
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It feels so good.

362
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Are you sleepy?

363
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Are you always sleepy?

364
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Wake up.

365
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It's hot.

366
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's amazing that you're young.

367
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Move more.

368
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I can't do it.

369
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It feels so good.

370
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I can't do it.

371
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I can't do it.

372
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It feels so good.

373
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Wait.

374
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I can't do it.

375
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It's hot.

376
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It's hot, isn't it?

377
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I can't do it.

378
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I can't do it.

379
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I can't do it.

380
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Do it properly.

381
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I can't do it.

382
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It feels so good.

383
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's hot.

384
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It feels so good.

385
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's amazing.

386
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I can't do it.

387
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I can't do it.

388
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I moved my legs a lot.

389
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It feels so good.

390
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I can't do it.

391
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Do you want to do it again?

392
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Let's go together.

393
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Wait.

394
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I can't do it.

395
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I can't do it.

396
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I can't do it.

397
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Move more.

398
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I can't do it.

399
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
You're so cute.

400
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm surprised.

401
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I can't do it.

402
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's hot.

403
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I can't do it.

404
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Wait.

405
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I can't do it.

406
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Let's go!

407
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I can't do it.

408
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It's amazing.

409
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You did it three times in the morning.

410
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
You haven't done it yet.

411
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
You moved your legs a lot.

412
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
You did it three times in the morning.

413
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
You can still do it because your legs are so hard.

414
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I can't do it.

415
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I can't do it.

416
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I can't do it.

417
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's okay.

418
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
You can do it at home anytime.

419
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You should study hard.

420
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You were studying until a while ago.

421
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
When you finish studying, let's have sex again.

422
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
You can do it anytime because you're at home.

423
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Let's do it after studying.

424
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I can't do it.

425
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I can't concentrate on studying in this environment.

426
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I can't do it.

427
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I can't do it.

428
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm home.

429
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It smells good.

430
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It's curry rice.

431
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Give me a bite.

432
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Is this for me?

433
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I'm hungry.

434
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Home is the best.

435
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's rare to see you at home.

436
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Can you make curry for me?

437
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It looks delicious.

438
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
What's your name?

439
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm Naoki.

440
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Naoki.

441
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Thank you.

442
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
It's delicious.

443
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Who made this?

444
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
My mom.

445
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
This curry rice is the best.

446
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
What about you?

447
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I'm going out to buy something.

448
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's delicious.

449
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
It's been a while since I came home.

450
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Have some curry.

451
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Thank you.

452
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I'm Naoki.

453
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Thank you for the meal.

454
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Let's eat.

455
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It's delicious.

456
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
How many times have we met?

457
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Is it the third time?

458
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That's right.

459
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
It's been a while.

460
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
How have you been?

461
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Do you get along well?

462
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yes.

463
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It's delicious.

464
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You like curry, don't you?

465
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I love it.

466
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I think this curry is the best curry in the world.

467
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
My mom taught me that.

468
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Your mom's curry is delicious.

469
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Men say they can't take off their stomachs if they grab their stomachs.

470
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
What do you think?

471
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's right.

472
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I think rice is delicious.

473
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I'll make curry for my boyfriend.

474
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I'll make sure he doesn't miss it.

475
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
He hasn't met me at all lately.

476
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I see.

477
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I made curry for him.

478
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I want a boyfriend.

479
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
He hasn't met me at all lately.

480
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

481
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Yes, I have.

482
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
How about you?

483
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I don't have a girlfriend.

484
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
What do you do when you can't meet your girlfriend?

485
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
There are times when you want to meet your girlfriend.

486
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
There are times when you can't sleep.

487
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
When I can't sleep?

488
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I don't think so.

489
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
That's good.

490
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
You're a pervert, aren't you?

491
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
You look like a pervert.

492
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
What are you talking about?

493
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm not a pervert.

494
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I'm more like a souffle.

495
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
When I want someone to be close to me, I think it's important to have someone I can meet anytime.

496
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I see.

497
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You can meet your girlfriend as soon as you call her.

498
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
You can make a souffle.

499
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Try it.

500
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Here you are.

501
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
What's your name?

502
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
My girlfriend is a passenger.

503
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
A passenger?

504
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Yes.

505
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It's the exam period, isn't it?

506
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Yes, it is.

507
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
You can't meet your girlfriend at all.

508
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

509
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

510
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

511
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
We're both studying.

512
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I have a girlfriend.

513
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
That's great.

514
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
That's great.

515
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
If you can't meet your girlfriend, you must have a girlfriend.

516
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
You're a pervert, aren't you?

517
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That's why you should make a souffle.

518
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It's very convenient.

519
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
You can meet your girlfriend as soon as you call her.

520
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I was honest with you a while ago.

521
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
But I want to make a souffle now.

522
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I want to make a souffle at that time.

523
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I see.

524
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Wait a minute.

525
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Wait a minute.

526
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
What's this?

527
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Did I do this to you?

529
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Do you look like you're going to be stabbed?

530
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I see.

531
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
You were looking at my boobs, weren't you?

532
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
No, I didn't.

533
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Or did you look at my butt?

534
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Minami, wait a minute.

535
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I can't believe you're making a souffle with me.

536
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I'm your sister.

537
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I just realized something important.

538
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I'm your sister.

539
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
By the way, we're not connected to each other.

540
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
That means we can do it.

541
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
What are you talking about?

542
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I'm so happy.

543
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Minami, what are you doing?

544
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I can do it.

545
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Wait a minute.

546
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
It's painful, isn't it?

547
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
What are you talking about?

548
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

549
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I'll be your girlfriend.

550
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
You're so young.

551
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I don't hate you.

552
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
What are you doing?

553
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
You don't hate me, do you?

554
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
You're so cute.

555
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
You're so small.

556
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Do you like me?

557
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
You don't care about me, do you?

558
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Are you looking forward to it?

559
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Wait a minute.

560
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
You can't do that.

561
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I can't do that?

562
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
That's...

563
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Is that so?

564
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
You want me to do it, don't you?

565
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I want you to do it.

566
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
You're so cute.

567
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
It's hard.

568
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Was it this hard?

569
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm sorry I didn't notice.

570
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
It's hot.

571
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Hey.

572
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Do you have a lot of hair?

573
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I can't help it.

574
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I'll take care of your hair.

575
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
You smell like a good boy.

576
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
My head is spinning.

577
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
You're so cute.

578
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
You're so cute.

579
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Do you like me?

580
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I'm so cute.

581
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
You have a lot of hair.

582
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I'll take care of your hair.

583
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
It's delicious.

584
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I can't stop.

585
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
What's that?

586
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
You're so cute.

587
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Does it feel good?

588
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Your mouth.

589
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Did you like it?

590
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
No.

591
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Don't do that.

592
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I want to touch you.

593
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Is that okay?

594
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
We're not connected.

595
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,000
If you touch me, I'll put you in the blanket.

596
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I can't do it.

597
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I can't do it.

598
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Come here.

599
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Are you going to stop?

600
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Look at me.

601
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I'm like this because of you.

602
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Are you going to stop?

603
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It feels good when I put you in the blanket.

604
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Come here.

605
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I'll make you feel better.

606
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Does it feel good?

607
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Is it dangerous?

608
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I'm going to sleep.

609
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Wait a minute.

610
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I'll put you in the blanket.

611
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
There.

612
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
There.

613
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I'll put you in the blanket.

614
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I'll put you in the blanket.

615
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I'll put you in the blanket.

616
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I haven't put you in the blanket yet.

617
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Why did you stop?

618
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
You can't do that.

619
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
You can't do that until I tell you to stop.

620
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I want to touch you.

621
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It's hard.

622
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It's hard.

623
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It's hot.

624
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I want you to touch me.

625
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I want you to touch me.

626
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Come here.

627
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You can't do that.

628
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
You can't do that.

629
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Why did you stop?

630
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
You can't do that.

631
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I'm going to leave soon.

632
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Wait.

633
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Wait.

634
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I'm going to leave.

635
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I'm going to leave.

636
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Is it dangerous?

637
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I'm going to leave.

638
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
You can't do that.

639
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I'm going to leave.

640
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I'm going to leave.

641
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm going to leave.

642
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
It feels good.

643
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I want to move.

644
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Don't stop me.

645
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Don't stop me.

646
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
You're amazing.

647
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
You're amazing.

648
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
You're drooling.

649
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
You're drooling a lot.

650
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
She won't do this to me, will she?

651
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
She won't do this to me, will she?

652
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Come here.

653
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
You're drooling a lot.

654
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
You're drooling a lot.

655
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Did you feel good?

656
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Did you feel good?

657
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I wanted to do it more.

658
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I thought I could do it anytime.

659
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I'll let you go this time.

660
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
So, you can do it anytime.

661
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Did you feel good?

662
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
See you later.

663
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
What are you doing?

664
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
You're studying.

665
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
You're studying hard.

666
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I'm going to leave.

667
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It's okay.

668
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Don't worry about it.

669
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I'll do what I want to do.

670
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
You can study.

671
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Don't worry about it.

672
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Study.

673
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Don't worry about it.

674
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Don't worry about it.

675
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I'm studying.

676
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Don't worry about it.

677
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Study.

678
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I'm going to leave.

679
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Study.

680
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I'm going to leave.

681
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
You're the best.

682
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
You're drooling.

683
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I'm going to leave.

684
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I'm going to leave.

685
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I'm going to leave.

686
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I'm going to leave.

687
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I'm going to leave.

688
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I'm going to leave.

689
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I'm going to leave.

690
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Hey.

691
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
It's so good.

692
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I'm going to cry.

693
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Crunch, crunch, crunch.

694
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I'm going to cry.

695
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
The next problem is...

696
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I'm going to cry.

697
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I'm going to cry.

698
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I'm going to cry.

699
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I'm going to cry.

700
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
It's so good.

701
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I'm going to cry.

702
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I'm going to cry.

703
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Give it to me.

704
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I'm not going to bother you today.

705
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I'm going to cry.

706
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
It's hot.

707
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
It's very hard.

708
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I'm going to cry.

709
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I'm going to cry.

710
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I'm going to cry.

711
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Do you want me?

712
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Do you want me?

713
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
You have to say you want me.

714
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I want you.

715
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I'm going to cry.

716
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
You can do it.

717
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
It's hot.

718
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I'm going to cry.

719
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I'm going to cry.

720
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I'm going to cry.

721
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I love you.

722
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I'm going to cry.

723
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,760
A little more!

724
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,200
A little more!

725
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,060
Hang in there!

726
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,680
She rubbed my eyes.

727
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,840
She rubbed my eyes!

728
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,740
Ah!

729
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,280
Once more!

730
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
It hurts!

731
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Study hard!

732
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Study hard!

733
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Study hard!

734
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Study hard!

735
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Study hard!

736
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It's true that it's hard to study.

737
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It's true that it's hard to study.

738
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Then,

739
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I'll show you the problem here.

740
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I'll show you the problem here.

741
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I'll show you the problem here.

742
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
The problem here is...

743
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
A, B, and X?

744
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
A, B, and X?

745
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I don't know.

746
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I don't know.

747
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It feels good.

748
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I'll tell you.

749
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
This is the correct answer.

750
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
This is the correct answer.

751
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
This is the correct answer.

752
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
This is the correct answer.

753
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
It feels good.

754
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It feels good.

755
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I'll answer the equation.

756
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I'll answer the equation.

757
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
It's too good.

758
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
It's too good.

759
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Don't be so serious.

760
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Don't be so serious.

761
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Think about it.

762
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Think about it.

763
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Think about it.

764
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Let's go! Let's go!

765
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I can't stop it.

766
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I can't stop it.

767
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Show me.

768
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I have to see the problem.

769
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
The blood pressure is dropping.

770
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
The blood pressure is dropping.

771
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Oh, no!

772
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Oh, no!

773
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
The air is stuck to the ground.

774
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Oh, no!

775
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
It's so uncomfortable.

776
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Oh, no!

777
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Oh, no!

778
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I'm stuck.

779
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I'm stuck.

780
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I'm stuck.

781
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Oh, no!

782
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
It's coming.

783
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
It's coming.

784
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
It's stuck to my back.

785
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Why are you stopping it?

786
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
You can't stop it.

787
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Move your hips.

788
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Move your hands.

789
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
You have to study.

790
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Your hands are stuck.

791
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
You can't stop it.

792
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
No, you have to study.

793
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Move your hips.

794
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
No, no, no, no.

795
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
No!

796
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It's so uncomfortable.

797
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Isn't it?

798
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
What?

799
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Isn't it uncomfortable?

800
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I haven't said it's uncomfortable yet.

801
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Isn't it uncomfortable?

802
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
It's tight.

803
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
It's tight.

804
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
It's very tight.

805
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
It feels good.

806
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
It's tight.

807
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
It's tight.

808
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
It's tight.

809
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
It's tight.

810
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
It's coming out.

811
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
It's coming out.

812
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
It's coming out.

813
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
It's coming out.

814
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
It's tight.

815
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Study hard.

816
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
It's coming again.

817
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Study hard.

818
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Let's go to bed.

819
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Hurry up.

820
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Is this also studying?

821
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Is it okay?

822
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Hello.

823
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Minami.

824
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I was waiting for you.

825
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
What's in it?

826
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
You're cheating.

827
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I'm going out.

828
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
What do you want to do?

829
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I want to take a bath.

830
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
You said you'd go out with me anytime.

831
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
What were you doing alone?

832
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I'm going to take a bath.

833
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
What were you doing alone?

834
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Call me.

835
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I'm going to take a bath.

836
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You're cute.

837
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I'm going to take a bath.

838
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Do you like being with me?

839
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Does it feel good?

840
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
It feels good.

841
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
It feels good for me, too.

842
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
What?

843
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Did you wash it properly?

844
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I washed it properly.

845
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Really?

846
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I'll wash it for you.

847
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I washed it properly.

848
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
It's okay.

849
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I'll wash it properly.

850
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I'll use this.

851
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I'll wash it clean.

852
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I'll wash it clean.

853
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I'll wash it clean.

854
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
It feels good.

855
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I'm just washing it.

856
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
It's thick.

857
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Naoki.

858
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Don't you know Minami?

859
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I don't know her.

860
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I see.

861
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
It looks like she's back.

862
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Have you seen her yet?

863
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I haven't seen her yet.

864
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I haven't seen her yet.

865
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
What's wrong?

866
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I think she said she was going out.

867
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Really?

868
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Yes, I made a mistake.

869
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Are you going out again?

870
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I see.

871
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
We've been living together for about two months.

872
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
How's Minami?

873
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
She's doing well.

874
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I see.

875
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I see.

876
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:39,000
We've been getting along well.

877
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Really?

878
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
That's great.

879
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
It's all thanks to you.

880
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
It's all thanks to you.

881
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Minami.

882
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I wonder if she comes home when you're around.

883
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Yes, that's right.

884
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Really?

885
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Yes, we've been getting along well.

886
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Thank you.

887
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I'm looking forward to working with you.

888
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I'm looking forward to working with you.

889
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I'm looking forward to working with you.

890
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Minami.

891
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I wonder if she comes home when you're around.

892
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Your mother found out.

893
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I'm glad.

894
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I'm glad.

895
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I want to go to the bathroom.

896
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
This is the bathroom.

897
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I'm so cold.

898
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I'm so cold.

899
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
This is the bathroom.

900
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I'm so cold.

901
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I'm so cold.

902
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I want to go to the bathroom.

903
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I'm so cold.

904
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I'm so cold.

905
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
But I'm so happy.

906
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
It's delicious.

907
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I'm so happy.

908
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I'm so cold.

909
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I'm so cold.

910
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I'm so cold.

911
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Your face is wet.

912
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Did you see that?

913
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Do you want me to wash your face?

914
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Your face is wet.

915
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Did you clean your face?

916
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Yes.

917
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I'm so cold.

918
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I'm so cold.

919
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I want you to dry your face.

920
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I want you to dry your face.

921
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I'm so cold.

922
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Did you dry your face?

923
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I'm so cold.

924
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I'm so cold.

925
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I want you to dry your face.

926
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I'm so cold.

927
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I want you to dry your face.

928
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I want you to dry your face.

929
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I have a tongue.

930
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I have a tongue.

931
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Ouch!

932
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Ouch!

933
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
You have a lot of bumps.

934
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Ouch!

935
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I'm going to eat your bun.

936
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Ouch!

937
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I want you to rub my fingers.

938
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I want you to rub my fingers.

939
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Okay.

940
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I'll rub your fingers.

941
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Ouch!

942
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Ouch!

943
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
What's going on?

944
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
You have a lot of bumps.

945
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I want you to rub my fingers.

946
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I want you to rub my fingers.

947
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I want you to rub my fingers.

948
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I want you to rub my fingers.

949
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I want you to rub my fingers.

950
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I want you to rub my fingers.

951
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I want you to rub my fingers.

952
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Let's eat.

953
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Let's eat.

954
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Wait.

955
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Don't.

956
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
It's so hot!

957
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
It's so hot!

958
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
It's so hot!

959
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It's so hot!

960
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
It's so hot!

961
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Is it getting tight?

962
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Is it tight?

963
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Do you want me to cover your mouth?

964
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
It's so hot...

965
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
It's so hot...

966
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Are you scared?

967
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
It's so hot...

968
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000

It's hot.

977
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
It's hot.

978
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
It's hot.

979
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
It's hot.

980
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
It's hot.

981
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
It's hot.

982
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
It's hot.

983
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It's hot.

984
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
It's hot.

985
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It's hot.

986
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
It's hot.

987
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
It's hot.

988
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
It's hot.

989
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
It's hot.

990
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
It's hot.

991
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
It's hot.

992
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
It's hot.

993
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
It's hot.

994
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
It's hot.

995
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
It's hot.

996
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
It's hard.

997
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
What do you want to do?

998
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I can't wait.

999
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
What do you want to do?

1000
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I want to put it in my mouth.

1001
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Me, too.

1002
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Give it to me.

1003
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Give it to me.

1004
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Give it to me.

1005
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I can't wait.

1006
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
It's hot.

1007
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
It's hot.

1008
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
It's hot.

1009
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
It's hot.

1010
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I can't wait.

1011
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Do you like cats?

1012
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Do you like cats?

1013
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Do you like cats?

1014
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Do you like cats?

1015
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I can't wait.

1016
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
It's hot.

1017
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
It's hot.

1018
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I want to put it into my mouth.

1019
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
It's hot.

1020
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
It's hot.

1021
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
tilt

1022
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,880
Tipsy

1023
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,520
I want you to touch me

1024
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:41,120
I want you to touch me

1025
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:46,180
To the vinegar

1026
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Why did you stop me?

1027
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I told you not to stop me.

1028
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
You know that, don't you?

1029
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I told you not to do that.

1030
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
She found out.

1031
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Be quiet.

1032
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I'm hungry.

1033
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I'm hungry.

1034
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I'm so hungry.

1035
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I feel sick.

1036
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
I'm sick.

1037
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I'm sick.

1038
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I'm sick.

1039
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I'm sick.

1040
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I'm so sick.

1041
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I'm sick.

1042
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I'm sick.

1043
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I'm sick.

1044
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
I'm sick.

1045
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I'm sick.

1046
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I'm sick.

1047
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I'm sick.

1048
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I'm sick.

1049
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I'm sick.

1050
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I'm sick.

1051
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I'm sick.

1052
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I'm sick.

1053
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Come here.

1054
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Come here.

1055
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Come here.

1056
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Come here.

1057
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Oh, it feels so good.

1058
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
I feel like I'm in heaven.

1059
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
It feels so good.

1060
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I can't stop.

1061
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
It feels so good.

1062
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I feel like I'm in heaven.

1063
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I feel like I'm in heaven.

1064
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
It's so hard.

1065
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
It's so hard.

1066
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
It feels so good.

1067
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
I can't do it anymore.

1068
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I can't do it anymore.

1069
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
It's so hard.

1070
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Wow.

1071
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Hey, it's so slimy.

1072
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
There's a lot coming out.

1073
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
How was it?

1074
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
How was it?

1075
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
It's going to be fun from now on.

1076
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Because I can do it anytime.

1077
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Kiss?

1078
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Hey, Nanki?

1079
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Yes?

1080
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I think I heard Miyai's voice.

1081
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
What?

1082
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Do you know?

1083
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,000
No, I don't know.

1084
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I see. How many people are there?

1085
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Yes.

1086
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Oh, it feels good.

1087
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Oh, I'm sleepy.

1088
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Oh, I'm sleepy.

1089
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Hey, touch me.

1090
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I'm not taking a break.

1091
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
What?

1092
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
It's okay.

1093
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Touch me.

1094
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Oh, it feels good.

1095
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Oh, it feels good.

1096
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Oh, it feels good.

1097
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Oh, I'm sleepy.

1098
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Oh, it feels good.

1099
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Oh, I'm sleepy.

1100
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Oh, it feels good.

1101
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Oh, it feels good.

1102
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
What?

1103
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I'm going to do it.

1104
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I told you to touch me.

1105
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
No, not yet.

1106
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Oh, it feels good.

1107
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Oh, it feels good.

1108
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Oh, it feels good.

1109
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Oh, it feels good.

1110
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
No, not yet.

1111
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Oh, it feels good.

1112
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
No, not yet.

1113
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Oh, it feels good.

1114
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Hey, does it really hurt?

1115
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Hey, does it really hurt?

1116
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I can't believe it.

1117
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I'm sorry.

1118
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
I was going to do it.

1119
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Hey, let me stand up.

1120
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I can't do it right away.

1121
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Why?

1122
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Because I just went there.

1123
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
But you can stand up, right?

1124
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I can't do it today.

1125
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I'm sorry.

1126
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I can't do it.

1127
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I told you it's too early.

1128
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I told you it's too early.

1129
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
I can't do it.

1130
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I can't do it.

1131
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I put a rubber band on my waist.

1132
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
If you didn't put it on, it would have been faster.

1133
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I can't do it.

1134
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
I can't do it.

1135
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I can't do it.

1136
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Go home.

1137
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Why?

1138
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Go home.

1139
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I can't do it.

1140
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I can't do it.

1141
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I can't do it.

1142
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Don't throw away the rubber band.

1143
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I know.

1144
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I'll throw it away.

1145
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I'll give you a tissue.

1146
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I can't do it.

1147
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I can't do it.

1148
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Why do I have to complain?

1149
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I'm so annoyed.

1150
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I'm so annoyed.

1151
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I'm so annoyed.

1152
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I can't use it.

1153
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I should have put it on my face.

1154
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Why did I say it's too early?

1155
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Why did I say it's too early?

1156
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I don't know.

1157
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I put a rubber band on my waist.

1158
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
If you didn't put it on, it would have been faster.

1159
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
If you didn't put it on, it would have been faster.

1160
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I thought it was good.

1161
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I thought it was good.

1162
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I can't do it.

1163
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I can't do it.

1164
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I can't do it.

1165
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I'm home.

1166
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I'm home.

1167
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I'm home.

1168
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I'm home.

1169
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I'm home.

1170
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
What is it?

1171
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
It's nothing.

1172
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
It's nothing.

1173
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Who was it?

1174
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
There was a man.

1175
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
What was his name?

1176
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Taro? No.

1177
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Shinji? No.

1178
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
He was a man before.

1179
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Who was his name?

1180
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I can't remember.

1181
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I can't remember.

1182
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
There was a man.

1183
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
There was a man.

1184
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
He was a good man.

1185
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
He was a student.

1186
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
He was young.

1187
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
He was a voice actor.

1188
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
There was a good man.

1189
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I can't remember his name.

1190
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I can't remember his name.

1191
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I'm home.

1192
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I'm home.

1193
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Ami.

1194
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
What are you doing?

1195
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I have a day off.

1196
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
It's not good.

1197
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Why?

1198
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
It's not good.

1199
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Why?

1200
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Kenji is there.

1201
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Kenji?

1202
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I don't remember his name.

1203
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Kenji?

1204
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Kenji?

1205
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I'm kidding.

1206
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I'm kidding.

1207
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I remember his name.

1208
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I remember.

1209
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I remember.

1210
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I told you it's not good.

1211
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
I told you it's not good.

1212
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I know.

1213
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I know.

1214
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I know.

1215
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Wait.

1216
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I haven't confirmed it yet.

1217
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I haven't confirmed it yet.

1218
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
My brother is...

1219
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
My brother is...

1220
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
My mother's son.

1221
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
What are you talking about?

1222
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
It's been 3 to 4 months.

1223
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
He wasn't at home.

1224
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
It's been 3 to 4 months.

1225
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
He wasn't at home.

1226
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
He wasn't at home.

1227
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
He was my brother.

1228
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
He was my brother.

1229
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Why is his blood connected?

1230
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
It's not related.

1231
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
It's not related.

1232
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Are you crazy?

1233
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Are you crazy?

1234
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
It's not related.

1235
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
It's not related.

1236
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Wait.

1237
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I'm sorry.

1238
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
I know.

1239
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
It's not related.

1240
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
It's not related.

1241
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
In a drama,

1242
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
In a drama,

1243
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
they get married.

1244
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,360
Like marriage.

1245
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,240
Marriage?

1246
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:43,760
It's in the drama.

1247
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:44,280
Drama?

1248
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,280
Yeah.

1249
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,160
I mean,

1250
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:50,960
it's not like they're not related,

1251
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,440
so there's no problem.

1252
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,800
Right?

1253
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,960
I don't think there's a problem,

1254
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,360
but that's what I'm thinking.

1255
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:01,840
No, no, no, no.

1256
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,480
There's no way.

1257
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,600
There's a distinction.

1258
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,560
It's complicated, so it's in the drama.

1259
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:08,080
Yeah, right.

1260
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:08,920
It's not good.

1261
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,520
No, no, no, it's not about me.

1262
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:12,640
It's about a friend.

1263
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:13,240
A friend?

1264
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,280
Yeah, recently,

1265
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:17,600
my parents got married again,

1266
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,360
and they had a sibling.

1267
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,600
Isn't it my family?

1268
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:23,560
Yeah, I thought it was similar.

1269
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:24,920
I told you.

1270
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:26,520
Confirmation.

1271
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:29,040
I told you, but I'll tell you later.

1272
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:29,840
Well.

1273
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,080
So there's no problem.

1274
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,120
There's no problem, but there is.

1275
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:35,680
That's why it's in the drama, right?

1276
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:37,600
Yeah, well, well, well.

1277
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:38,680
You know that, don't you?

1278
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,080
I know.

1279
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,640
How many times have I told you?

1280
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:42,560
How long are you going to be childish?

1281
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,040
That's enough, that's enough.

1282
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,640
I'm always telling you to dress up.

1283
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:49,080
Well, you should change.

1284
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:50,440
Yes, yes.

1285
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:51,240
Oh, no, no, no.

1286
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,080
It's creaking.

1287
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:55,000
Oh, no.

1288
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
There's no problem.

1289
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:06,360
So I can do it, right?

1290
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,680
Well, let's do it.

1291
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,680
Yes.

1292
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:25,680
Can I come in?

1293
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:27,680
Oh, yes, please.

1294
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,680
What, are you studying?

1295
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:31,680
Oh, yes.

1296
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,680
Ero.

1297
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:35,680
Hey, your brother.

1298
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,680
Oh, yes.

1299
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,680
Yes.

1300
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,680
Kenji?

1301
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:42,680
Yes, I'm Kenji.

1302
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:44,680
So what?

1303
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,680
How many years are you in now?

1304
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:47,680
About 2 or 3 years old.

1305
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:48,680
Oh, I'm in my third year now.

1306
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:49,680
You're in your third year, right?

1307
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:50,680
I knew it.

1308
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,680
That's right, I knew it.

1309
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,680
I told you.

1310
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:53,680
So what?

1311
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:54,680
Exam this year?

1312
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:55,680
That's right.

1313
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:57,680
Wow, that's great.

1314
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:59,680
Is there anything amazing about it?

1315
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:01,680
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1316
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:02,680
Well, but a little.

1317
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:04,680
Yes, I'll do my best.

1318
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:05,680
That's right.

1319
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:07,680
You said you were going to get into a good place, didn't you?

1320
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,680
Well.

1321
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:12,680
That's great.

1322
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:14,680
You've been studying all the time.

1323
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:16,680
Don't you have a club?

1324
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:17,680
One study?

1325
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:19,680
I've already retired from the club.

1326
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,680
Oh, you're retired.

1327
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,680
Oh, you said you were retired.

1328
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:22,680
What club was it?

1329
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,680
Was it something like soccer?

1330
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,680
Oh, it was a track and field club.

1331
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:26,680
Oh, a track and field club.

1332
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:28,680
That's a lot of information.

1333
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:30,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

1334
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:32,680
Oh, I see.

1335
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:33,680
Oh, I see.

1336
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:34,680
Huh.

1337
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,680
What, do you have a girlfriend?

1338
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:41,680
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1339
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:43,680
I don't have a girlfriend.

1340
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:45,680
You don't have a girlfriend?

1341
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:46,680
Oh, oh.

1342
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:47,680
Really?

1343
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:48,680
Oh, yeah.

1344
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:49,680
Since when?

1345
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:50,680
Since when?

1346
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:54,680
No, even if you ask me when, I'm not sure.

1347
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,680
So what?

1348
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:00,680
Have you had a girlfriend since you've been in school?

1349
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:04,680
Not exactly, but we were together for 2 years.

1350
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:05,680
Oh, you were together?

1351
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:09,680
Wow, that's great. You're still young.

1352
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:15,680
But now I really want to pass the exam.

1353
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:16,680
You're so talkative.

1354
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:17,680
No, no, no.

1355
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:19,680
That's great.

1356
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:22,680
I see.

1357
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:25,680
I've always wanted a younger brother.

1358
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,680
It's great to have a younger brother.

1359
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,680
That's true.

1360
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:34,680
I'm happy to hear that.

1361
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:38,680
I think it's a good thing to have a younger brother.

1362
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:45,680
You don't have many siblings, do you?

1363
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:46,680
Do you have a lot of siblings?

1364
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:48,680
No, but I've been single all my life.

1365
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:50,680
Wow, that's great.

1366
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:55,680
I'm happy to have an older sister.

1367
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:59,680
Really? I'm happy to hear that.

1368
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:05,680
I think it's a good thing to have a younger brother.

1369
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:08,680
It's a good thing to have a younger brother.

1370
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:11,680
I think so, too.

1371
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:14,680
I think so, too.

1372
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:16,680
I think so, too.

1373
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:22,680
Which do you prefer, having a younger sister or having a younger brother?

1374
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:27,680
What do you think?

1375
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:29,680
I don't know.

1376
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:32,680
I think it's a good thing to have a younger brother.

1377
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:35,680
Did you know that?

1378
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:36,680
What?

1379
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:41,680
If you don't have a younger brother, you can do a lot of things.

1380
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:43,680
A lot of things?

1381
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,680
A lot of things.

1382
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:49,680
Did you know that?

1383
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:52,680
I don't want to make it a problem.

1384
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:54,680
I was wondering what to do.

1385
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:57,680
But when I checked it earlier, it said there was no problem.

1386
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:01,680
What did you check?

1387
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:03,680
There's no problem.

1388
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,680
Even if you do this.

1389
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:08,680
You can do this.

1390
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:09,680
Did you know that?

1391
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:11,680
I don't know.

1392
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,680
Did you know that?

1393
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:15,680
There's no problem if you mess with this.

1394
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:20,680
He said it's okay because he doesn't have a younger brother.

1395
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:26,680
It's not good.

1396
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:28,680
You can't do that.

1397
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:30,680
I can't?

1398
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:48,680
It's good.

1399
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:50,680
It's good to have a younger brother.

1400
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:52,680
It's the best.

1401
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:54,680
What?

1402
01:43:54,680 --> 01:44:00,680
What's wrong?

1403
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:02,680
What's wrong?

1404
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:04,680
It's okay. There's no problem.

1405
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:07,680
Don't worry. I won't make a problem.

1406
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:12,680
I've decided not to make a problem since I became an adult.

1407
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:15,680
I've decided not to make a problem since I became an adult.

1408
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:17,680
It's okay.

1409
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:20,680
It's okay.

1410
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:22,680
Your neck is standing up.

1411
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:24,680
It's okay.

1412
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:26,680
Is that so?

1413
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:28,680
I'm sorry. I'm the only one touching you.

1414
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,680
I'm sorry.

1415
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,680
Tell me.

1416
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:34,680
You're my brother.

1417
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:38,680
You prepared a different kind of tea.

1418
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:40,680
Do you want to touch me?

1419
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:42,680
I'll touch you.

1420
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:46,680
I'll touch you, too.

1421
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:51,680
Touch me a lot.

1422
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:56,680
How is it?

1423
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:59,680
It's big and soft.

1424
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:01,680
Can I touch you from here?

1425
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:03,680
I touched you like this.

1426
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,680
I touched you like this.

1427
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,680
I touched you like this.

1428
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:15,680
You can touch me.

1429
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:19,680
I can't touch you.

1430
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,680
Can't you touch me?

1431
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:23,680
I'm in trouble.

1432
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:26,680
I'll touch you from here.

1433
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:30,680
It feels good.

1434
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:32,680
Does it feel good?

1435
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:33,680
It feels good.

1436
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:35,680
It feels really good.

1437
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:37,680
Let's lick your boobs.

1438
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:39,680
Lick?

1439
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:42,680
Let's lick your boobs.

1440
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:44,680
Go to the futon.

1441
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:47,680
How do you take off your necktie?

1442
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:48,680
I took it off.

1443
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:50,680
Go to the futon.

1444
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,680
Go to the futon.

1445
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:05,680
Lick my boobs.

1446
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:07,680
Can I?

1447
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:10,680
What?

1448
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:12,680
I checked that there was no problem.

1449
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:14,680
Lick my boobs.

1450
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,680
It feels good.

1451
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:23,680
It feels good.

1452
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:28,680
Is there really no problem?

1453
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:30,680
I told you there was no problem.

1454
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:32,680
I told you there was no problem.

1455
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:34,680
Lick my boobs.

1456
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,680
It feels good.

1457
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,680
It feels good.

1458
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:51,680
I'll lick your boobs, too.

1459
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,680
This side?

1460
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:00,680
Which side do you like?

1461
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,680
Right or left?

1462
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:04,680
I don't know.

1463
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:06,680
Which side is sensitive?

1464
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:08,680
I don't know.

1465
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:35,680
Does it feel good?

1466
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:37,680
Great.

1467
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:39,680
This side is bigger.

1468
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:46,680
How about this side?

1469
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:51,680
How about this side?

1470
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,680
What?

1471
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:55,680
How about here?

1472
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:58,680
When was the last time you licked here?

1473
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:02,680
When was the last time you licked here?

1474
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:05,680
You didn't do it?

1475
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:13,680
You did it yesterday.

1476
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:15,680
What did you do?

1477
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:21,680
What?

1478
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,680
What did you do?

1479
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,680
Nothing.

1480
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:32,680
I was reading a book.

1481
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:36,680
I see.

1482
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:38,680
You're watching a video.

1483
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:40,680
That's right.

1484
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:44,680
That's right.

1485
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:47,680
You should have told me.

1486
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:49,680
I would have given you a treat.

1487
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:51,680
What?

1488
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:55,680
You've had a lot of boyfriends.

1489
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,680
What?

1490
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:59,680
What a waste.

1491
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:04,680
But, you know...

1492
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:07,680
You don't have to worry about a treat anymore.

1493
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:10,680
Right?

1494
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:12,680
What?

1495
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:16,680
You're doing this.

1496
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:18,680
I'm embarrassed.

1497
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:21,680
Are you embarrassed?

1498
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:23,680
Are you embarrassed?

1499
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:25,680
I'm scared.

1500
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:27,680
You're embarrassed.

1501
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:34,680
Show me your face.

1502
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:38,680
You're amazing.

1503
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:40,680
You're so energetic.

1504
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:42,680
You did it yesterday, right?

1505
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:44,680
That's why your ears are like this.

1506
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:46,680
You're amazing.

1507
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:48,680
It's good to be young.

1508
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:56,680
It's good to be young.

1509
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,680
You smell.

1510
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,680
You smell.

1511
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:07,680
I don't smell.

1512
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:10,680
You haven't changed since you came back from school.

1513
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:12,680
You smell.

1514
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:16,680
I think you smell like a gentleman.

1515
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,680
Why?

1516
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:21,680
Really?

1517
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:23,680
You didn't do it yesterday.

1518
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:25,680
You did it a while ago.

1519
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:30,680
I feel sorry for you.

1520
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:32,680
I feel sorry for you.

1521
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:34,680
I feel sorry for you.

1522
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:44,680
I feel sorry for you.

1523
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:46,680
I feel sorry for you.

1524
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:52,680
I'll make it easy for you.

1525
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:14,680
It's fun.

1526
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:16,680
You're the best.

1527
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:18,680
You're the best.

1528
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:20,680
Kenji.

1529
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:26,680
You react well.

1530
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,680
You're the best.

1531
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:30,680
You're the best.

1532
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:47,680
You're the best.

1533
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:54,680
I can't stand it.

1534
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:56,680
What?

1535
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:58,680
What?

1536
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:00,680
That's not good.

1537
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:03,680
It's okay. I told you it's okay.

1538
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:05,680
It's okay.

1539
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:07,680
Shut up.

1540
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,680
Look.

1541
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:14,680
It's not in yet.

1542
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:16,680
It's not in yet.

1543
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:18,680
It's not in yet.

1544
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:20,680
It's in.

1545
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:23,680
You're the best.

1546
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:26,680
I'm sorry.

1547
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:29,680
You're good.

1548
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:31,680
I feel great.

1549
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:33,680
I can't do it.

1550
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:37,680
I feel great.

1551
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:39,680
I feel like I'm going to die.

1552
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,680
You can't do it.

1553
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:43,680
You can't do it.

1554
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:45,680
You can't do it.

1555
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:47,680
You have to endure it.

1556
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:49,680
Do you understand?

1557
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,680
You can't do it until I say so.

1558
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:53,680
Do you understand?

1559
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:55,680
Do you understand?

1560
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:57,680
You can't do it until I say so.

1561
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:59,680
Do you understand?

1562
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:01,680
Do you understand?

1563
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:05,680
I feel great.

1564
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:11,680
I can't do it.

1565
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:15,680
I feel great.

1566
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:17,680
I feel like I'm going to die.

1567
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:22,680
I feel great.

1568
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:28,680
I feel great.

1569
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:30,680
You're the best.

1570
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:32,680
You can't do it.

1571
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:34,680
You can't do it.

1572
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:36,680
You have to endure it.

1573
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:38,680
I feel great.

1574
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:40,680
I feel great.

1575
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:47,680
I feel great.

1576
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:55,680
I feel great.

1577
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:59,680
Even if I feel more than I do yesterday...

1578
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:07,680
It feels like five times more than yesterday.

1579
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:09,680
It feels the best.

1580
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:13,680
It's fun.

1581
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,680
This is not good.

1582
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:25,680
It feels good.

1583
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:27,680
Hey.

1584
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:29,680
Kenji.

1585
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,680
I tried it.

1586
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:33,680
Follow me.

1587
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:35,680
Follow me.

1588
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:37,680
Yes, yes.

1589
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:39,680
More, more, more.

1590
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:41,680
Yes, yes.

1591
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:43,680
No.

1592
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:45,680
Don't go.

1593
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:47,680
Don't go.

1594
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,680
No.

1595
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:51,680
It feels good.

1596
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:53,680
No.

1597
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:59,680
It feels good.

1598
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:03,680
It's the best.

1599
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:05,680
Give me more.

1600
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:09,680
Kenji.

1601
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:11,680
Do it again.

1602
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:13,680
Do it again.

1603
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:15,680
Yes.

1604
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:17,680
It feels good.

1605
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:19,680
Oh, no.

1606
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:21,680
Oh, no.

1607
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,680
It feels good.

1608
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:27,680
No, no, no.

1609
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:29,680
It's great.

1610
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,680
It feels good.

1611
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:35,680
Yes.

1612
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:41,680
Oh, no.

1613
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:43,680
It feels good.

1614
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:47,680
No.

1615
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:51,680
No.

1616
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,680
Wait. It feels good.

1617
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:55,680
No.

1618
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:57,680
Let's go.

1619
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:59,680
Oh, no.

1620
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:05,680
It feels good.

1621
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:11,680
More.

1622
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:13,680
It feels good.

1623
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:19,680
It feels good.

1624
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,680
No.

1625
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:27,680
Oh, no.

1626
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:37,680
It feels good.

1627

It feels good.

1630
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:49,680
Really?

1631
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:51,680
Really?

1632
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:53,680
Yes.

1633
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:55,680
Go.

1634
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,680
Go.

1635
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:59,680
You can go.

1636
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:03,680
You can go.

1637
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:11,680
It feels good.

You can go.

1643
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:35,680
I want to go out.

1644
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:45,680
It's great.

1645
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:47,680
You're so energetic that you can go out.

1646
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:49,680
You're so energetic that you can go out.

1647
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:51,680
It's great.

1648
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:55,680
It's hot.

1649
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:57,680
It's hot.

1650
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:05,680
It's hot.

1651
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:07,680
It feels good.

1652
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:09,680
Actually, I wanted to do more.

1653
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:11,680
Actually, I wanted to do more.

1654
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:13,680
It's okay.

1655
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:15,680
It felt so good.

1656
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:17,680
I'll forgive you today.

1657
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:19,680
It's hot.

1658
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:21,680
Calm down.

1659
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:23,680
It felt so good.

1660
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:25,680
I'll get along with you.

1661
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:27,680

Good luck with your study.

Good luck with your study.

1664
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:39,680
See you later.

Why are you sleeping?

Why are you sleeping?

1670
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:07,680
Kenji, good morning.

Kenji, good morning.

1672
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:11,680
Why don't you wake up?

1673
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:15,680
Why?

1674
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:17,680
Why?

1675
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:19,680
Why?

1676
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:21,680
I gave you a chance.

1677
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:23,680
I gave you a chance.

1678
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:25,680
I gave you a chance.

1679
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:27,680
Why are you sleeping?

01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:48,680
Why are you in my room?

1686
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:50,680
Why are you in my room?

1687
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:02,680
He's here.

1688
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:04,680
He's here.

1689
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:06,680
He has a button.

1690
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:08,680
He has a button.

1691
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:14,680
You were awake.

1692

I'm trying to wake you up

1701
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:46,300
you know what?

1702
02:00:46,300 --> 02:00:49,900
You just came back from the school reunion.

1703
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:54,420
You said you have a good girl at home.

1704
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:55,700
You refused to be a manager.

1705
02:00:55,700 --> 02:00:57,300
Why are you sleeping?

1706
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:59,020
I don't want you to say that.

1707
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:05,260
How long are you sleeping?

1708
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:07,700
What time do you think it is?

1709
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:10,940
I'm going to sleep at this time.

1710
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:14,220
It's not time yet.

1711
02:01:14,220 --> 02:01:16,660
It's going to be dark soon.

1712
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:19,300
It's early.

1713
02:01:19,300 --> 02:01:22,180
Why do you try to sleep right away?

1714
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:32,500
Hey, lick here.

What?

1722
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:07,820
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

1723
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:11,940
You've been studying too much, so you've gone crazy, haven't you?

1724
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:22,900
Hey, lick here.

1725
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:27,620
Your eyes are very wet, aren't they?

1726
02:02:27,620 --> 02:02:31,020
I was looking forward to talking to you.

1727
02:02:31,020 --> 02:02:36,620
You've been wet all the way from the train.

1728
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:39,340
Oh, it feels good.

Lick a lot.

1733
02:03:06,820 --> 02:03:09,420
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1734
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:18,020
You can lick it.

1735
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:20,020
Oh, it feels good.

Here.

1743
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:12,020
You wanted to put it in early, didn't you?

1744
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:14,020
Oh, that's...

1745

Do you want to see it better?

1753

You're a pervert, aren't you?

1754

1876
02:12:53,020 --> 02:13:04,020
Oh, it feels good.

1877
02:13:04,020 --> 02:13:19,020
Oh, it feels good.

1878
02:13:19,020 --> 02:13:24,020
Oh, it feels good.

1879
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:27,020
I'm sleepy.

1880
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:30,020
I want to sleep like this.

1881
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:41,020
I have to take this off.

1882
02:13:41,020 --> 02:13:45,020
It's hot.

1883
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:52,020
Can I sleep here?

1884
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:55,020
Let's sleep.

1885
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:56,020
Let's sleep.

1886
02:13:56,020 --> 02:14:00,020
Don't you want to sleep?

1887
02:14:00,020 --> 02:14:02,020
What?

1888
02:14:02,020 --> 02:14:04,020
Can I sleep here?

1889
02:14:04,020 --> 02:14:09,020
It's the same house.

1890
02:14:09,020 --> 02:14:13,020
Good night.

1891
02:14:13,020 --> 02:14:26,020
Oh, it feels good.

1892
02:14:26,020 --> 02:14:27,020
Kenji.

1893
02:14:27,020 --> 02:14:28,020
Yes.

1894
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:29,020
Can I talk to you for a moment?

1895
02:14:29,020 --> 02:14:32,020
What?

1896
02:14:32,020 --> 02:14:33,020
Kenji.

1897
02:14:33,020 --> 02:14:40,020
Wait a minute.

1898
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:46,020
Wait a minute.

1899
02:14:46,020 --> 02:14:48,020
Yes.

1900
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:52,020
I'm coming in.

1901
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:54,020
I'm sorry to wake you up early in the morning.

1902
02:14:54,020 --> 02:14:55,020
It's okay.

1903
02:14:55,020 --> 02:15:00,020
Did Ami come home yesterday?

1904
02:15:00,020 --> 02:15:06,020
What?

1905
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:10,020
I didn't see it.

1906
02:15:10,020 --> 02:15:14,020
I see.

1907
02:15:14,020 --> 02:15:17,020
I told her to come home.

1908
02:15:17,020 --> 02:15:21,020
I have to wait.

1909
02:15:21,020 --> 02:15:22,020
I'm sorry.

1910
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:26,020
I told Ami to come home with a new family.

1911
02:15:26,020 --> 02:15:29,020
I see.

1912
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:33,020
You have a good daughter.

1913
02:15:33,020 --> 02:15:36,020
What?

1914
02:15:36,020 --> 02:15:37,020
Are you okay?

1915
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:39,020
I'm fine.

1916
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:42,020
I told you to come home.

1917
02:15:42,020 --> 02:15:44,020
I see.

1918
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:46,020
Do you think so?

1919
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:48,020
Yes.

1920
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:53,020
I want you to be strong.

1921
02:15:53,020 --> 02:15:56,020
Did I raise you badly?

1922
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:58,020
I don't think so.

1923
02:15:58,020 --> 02:16:01,020
I'm bothering you a lot.

1924
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:04,020
No, I don't think so.

1925
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:07,020
I raised you alone.

1926
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:10,020
I don't think it was good.

1927
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:15,020
I don't think so.

1928
02:16:15,020 --> 02:16:17,020
I don't think so.

1929
02:16:17,020 --> 02:16:20,020
I don't think so.

1930
02:16:20,020 --> 02:16:23,020
I want you to be happy.

1931
02:16:23,020 --> 02:16:26,020
I want you to get married in a few years.

1932
02:16:26,020 --> 02:16:27,020
I don't think so.

1933
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:34,020
Ami is coming out.

1934
02:16:34,020 --> 02:16:38,020
Ami is coming out.

1935
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:40,020
I'm going home.

1936
02:16:40,020 --> 02:16:42,020
I'm sorry.

1937
02:16:42,020 --> 02:16:45,020
Please tell me when Ami comes home.

1938
02:16:45,020 --> 02:16:46,020
I'm sorry.

1939
02:16:54,020 --> 02:16:55,020
I'm sorry.

1940
02:16:55,020 --> 02:16:56,020
What?

1941
02:16:56,020 --> 02:16:57,020
I'm going to be found out.

1942
02:16:57,020 --> 02:16:58,020
Are you going to be found out?

1943
02:16:58,020 --> 02:16:59,020
I'm going to be found out.

1944
02:16:59,020 --> 02:17:00,020
What are you going to do if you are found out?

1945
02:17:00,020 --> 02:17:01,020
What are you going to do if you are found out?

1946
02:17:01,020 --> 02:17:03,020
I'm fine.

1947
02:17:03,020 --> 02:17:06,020
My father told me that I was safe.

1948
02:17:06,020 --> 02:17:08,020
You are not safe.

1949
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:12,020
I'm safe.

1950
02:17:15,020 --> 02:17:16,020
What?

1951
02:17:17,020 --> 02:17:19,020
You are in a hurry.

1952
02:17:21,020 --> 02:17:22,020
What?

1953
02:17:23,020 --> 02:17:24,020
What if you are found out?

1954
02:17:25,020 --> 02:17:26,020
I'm going to be found out.

1955
02:17:26,020 --> 02:17:27,020
Are you going to be found out?

1956
02:17:33,020 --> 02:17:34,020
Hey.

1957
02:17:36,020 --> 02:17:37,020
I want to see you.

1958
02:17:38,020 --> 02:17:39,020
Look at you.

1959
02:17:40,020 --> 02:17:41,020
You are patient.

1960
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:42,020
You are patient.

1961
02:17:43,020 --> 02:17:44,020
What's wrong?

1962
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:45,020
You have a lot of hair.

1963
02:17:46,020 --> 02:17:47,020
You are going to be found out.

1964
02:17:48,020 --> 02:17:49,020
Look at you.

1965
02:17:51,020 --> 02:17:53,020
You have a lot of hair.

1966
02:17:54,020 --> 02:17:55,020
You have a lot of hair.

1967
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:57,020
I'm sorry.

1968
02:18:04,020 --> 02:18:05,020
You don't like it?

1969
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:07,020
You have a lot of hair.

1970
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:10,020
You don't like it?

1971
02:18:10,020 --> 02:18:11,020
You don't like it?

1972
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:15,020
What?

1973
02:18:25,020 --> 02:18:26,020
You don't like it?

1974
02:18:40,020 --> 02:18:41,020
I'm going to be found out.

1975
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:45,020
You can't do it yet.

1976
02:18:46,020 --> 02:18:48,020
Why do you want to be found out?

1977
02:18:58,020 --> 02:19:00,020
I want to do it.

1978
02:19:03,020 --> 02:19:05,020

I want to do it, too.

1980
02:19:41,020 --> 02:19:44,020
I want to do it, too.

1981
02:19:46,020 --> 02:19:48,020
You said you don't like it.

1982
02:19:49,020 --> 02:19:50,020
I'm sorry.

1983
02:20:06,020 --> 02:20:09,020
You are so impatient that I'm going to be found out.

1984
02:20:10,020 --> 02:20:11,020
You are so impatient that I'm going to be found out.

1985
02:20:35,020 --> 02:20:37,020
You are doing something amazing.

1986
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:42,020
You have been putting up with my body for a while.

1987
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:56,020
You have a lot of hair.

1988
02:20:56,020 --> 02:20:57,020
You don't like it?

1989
02:21:06,020 --> 02:21:07,020
What?

1990
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:08,020
You don't like it?

1991
02:21:08,020 --> 02:21:09,020
You don't like it?

1992
02:21:09,020 --> 02:21:10,020
You don't like it?

You have a lot of hair.

1994
02:21:18,020 --> 02:21:19,020
You are amazing.

1995
02:21:22,020 --> 02:21:24,020
It's getting harder and harder.

1996
02:21:26,020 --> 02:21:28,020
You are energetic.

1997
02:21:56,020 --> 02:21:57,020
You don't like it?

1998
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:21,020
It feels good.

You shouldn't do that.

Oh, no.

Don't stop.

2063
02:27:32,020 --> 02:27:33,020
Don't stop.

2064
02:27:34,020 --> 02:27:35,020
More.

2065
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:37,020
More.

2066
02:27:41,020 --> 02:27:42,020
It feels good.

2067
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:44,020
Give me more.

2068
02:27:45,020 --> 02:27:46,020
More.

2069
02:27:47,020 --> 02:27:48,020
More.

2070
02:27:50,020 --> 02:27:51,020
It feels good.

2071
02:27:57,020 --> 02:27:58,020
Go deeper.

2072
02:28:01,020 --> 02:28:02,020
No, no, no.

2073
02:28:02,020 --> 02:28:03,020
It feels good.

2074
02:28:07,020 --> 02:28:08,020
Oh, no.

It feels good.

2084
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:48,020
Touch more.

2085
02:28:50,020 --> 02:28:51,020
Oh, no.

2086
02:28:54,020 --> 02:28:55,020
It feels so good.

Oh, no.

2088
02:29:02,020 --> 02:29:03,020
Go deeper.

2089
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:05,020
Oh, no.

2090
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:08,020
It feels good.

2091
02:29:09,020 --> 02:29:10,020

No, I can't stop.

2095
02:29:23,020 --> 02:29:24,020
More.

2096
02:29:27,020 --> 02:29:28,020
What?

2097
02:29:34,020 --> 02:29:35,020
Oh, no.

2098
02:29:38,020 --> 02:29:39,020
It feels good.

2099
02:29:47,020 --> 02:29:48,020
Oh, no.

2100
02:29:51,020 --> 02:29:52,020
It feels good.

2101
02:29:56,020 --> 02:29:57,020
Give me more.

2102
02:30:05,020 --> 02:30:06,020
It feels good.

2103
02:30:07,020 --> 02:30:08,020
Oh, no.

2104
02:30:13,020 --> 02:30:14,020
It feels good here.

2105
02:30:19,020 --> 02:30:20,020
It feels good here.

2106
02:30:20,020 --> 02:30:21,020
Oh, no.

2107
02:30:24,020 --> 02:30:25,020
No, it feels good.

2108
02:30:31,020 --> 02:30:32,020
Oh, no.

2109
02:30:33,020 --> 02:30:34,020
Go here.

2110
02:30:34,020 --> 02:30:35,020
Go here.

2111
02:30:35,020 --> 02:30:36,020
Go here.

2112
02:30:46,020 --> 02:30:47,020
It feels good.

2113
02:30:50,020 --> 02:30:51,020
More.

2114
02:30:51,020 --> 02:30:52,020
Here.

2115
02:30:54,020 --> 02:30:55,020

It feels good here.

2118
02:31:01,020 --> 02:31:02,020
Oh, no.

2119
02:31:02,020 --> 02:31:03,020
I want more.

2120
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:04,020
I want more.

2121
02:31:04,020 --> 02:31:05,020
Oh, no.

2122
02:31:05,020 --> 02:31:06,020
I can't stop.

2123
02:31:06,020 --> 02:31:07,020
I can't stop.

2124
02:31:07,020 --> 02:31:08,020
I can't stop.

2125
02:31:09,020 --> 02:31:10,020
I can't stop.

2126
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:11,020
I can't stop.

2127
02:31:13,020 --> 02:31:14,020
It feels good.

2128
02:31:15,020 --> 02:31:16,020
Go.

2129
02:31:25,020 --> 02:31:26,020
It feels good.

2130
02:31:26,020 --> 02:31:27,020
Oh, no.

2131
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:29,020
Oh, no.

2132
02:31:29,020 --> 02:31:32,020
You're all wet.

2133
02:31:33,020 --> 02:31:35,020
Why did you do that?

2134
02:31:35,020 --> 02:31:36,020
It's not good.

2135
02:31:39,020 --> 02:31:40,020
More here.

2136
02:31:41,020 --> 02:31:42,020
It feels good.

2137
02:31:44,020 --> 02:31:45,020
Oh, no.

2138
02:31:45,020 --> 02:31:46,020
It feels good.

2139

Oh, no.

2140
02:31:47,020 --> 02:31:48,020
Come here.

2141
02:31:51,020 --> 02:31:52,020
It's a mess.

2142
02:31:54,020 --> 02:31:55,020
Oh, no.

2143
02:31:55,020 --> 02:31:56,020
It feels good.

2144
02:31:57,020 --> 02:31:58,020
Oh, no.

2145
02:32:13,020 --> 02:32:14,020
It feels good.

2146
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:17,020
More.

2147
02:32:17,020 --> 02:32:18,020
Give me more.

2148
02:32:20,020 --> 02:32:21,020
More.

2149
02:32:25,020 --> 02:32:26,020
It feels good.

2150
02:32:28,020 --> 02:32:29,020
It feels good.

2151
02:32:29,020 --> 02:32:30,020
Oh, no.

2152
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:32,020
It feels good.

2153
02:32:36,020 --> 02:32:37,020
Oh, no.

2154
02:32:39,020 --> 02:32:40,020
It feels good.

2155
02:32:48,020 --> 02:32:49,020
What?

2156
02:32:50,020 --> 02:32:51,020
What?

2157
02:32:54,020 --> 02:32:55,020
Let's go together.

2158
02:32:55,020 --> 02:32:56,020
Together.

2159
02:32:58,020 --> 02:32:59,020
Oh, no.

2160
02:32:59,020 --> 02:33:00,020
It feels good.

2161
02:33:00,020 --> 02:33:01,020
Oh, no.

2162
02:33:03,020 --> 02:33:04,020
Let's go.

2163
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:05,020
No.

2164
02:33:05,020 --> 02:33:06,020
Let's go.

2165
02:33:15,020 --> 02:33:16,020
It feels good.

2166
02:33:28,020 --> 02:33:29,020
It feels good.

2167
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:35,020
Oh, no.

2168
02:33:35,020 --> 02:33:36,020
What time is it?

2169
02:33:36,020 --> 02:33:37,020
What?

2170
02:33:37,020 --> 02:33:39,020
I'm going to be late for work.

2171
02:33:41,020 --> 02:33:43,020
You're going to be late for school, too.

2172
02:33:43,020 --> 02:33:44,020
That's right.

2173
02:33:45,020 --> 02:33:46,020
Oh, no.

2174
02:33:46,020 --> 02:33:47,020
I have to change.

2175
02:33:47,020 --> 02:33:48,020
I have to get ready.

2176
02:33:48,020 --> 02:33:49,020
That's right.

2177
02:33:49,020 --> 02:33:50,020
I have to go to school.

2178
02:33:50,020 --> 02:33:51,020
What?

2179
02:33:52,020 --> 02:33:54,020
You have to go to school.

2180
02:33:54,020 --> 02:33:56,020
You have to go to school.

2181
02:33:57,020 --> 02:33:58,020
Hey.

2182
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:02,020
Let's continue when you get home.

2183
02:34:02,020 --> 02:34:03,020
What?

2184
02:34:03,020 --> 02:34:05,020
Let's continue when you get home.

2185
02:34:05,020 --> 02:34:06,020
Continue?

2186
02:34:06,020 --> 02:34:07,020
Continue what?

2187
02:34:07,020 --> 02:34:08,020
That's right.

2188
02:34:09,020 --> 02:34:10,020
No.

2189
02:34:10,020 --> 02:34:11,020
I don't feel well.

2190
02:34:12,020 --> 02:34:13,020
What?

2191
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:14,020
Don't worry.

2192
02:34:14,020 --> 02:34:16,020
When you go to school, you can take a break.

2193
02:34:16,020 --> 02:34:18,020
Let's continue when you get home.

2194
02:34:19,020 --> 02:34:20,020
Hey.

2195
02:34:20,020 --> 02:34:21,020
We're brothers.

2196
02:34:21,020 --> 02:34:22,020
We're brothers.

2197
02:34:22,020 --> 02:34:24,020
You have to say you want to do it.

2198
02:34:24,020 --> 02:34:26,020
You have to say you want to do it.

2199
02:34:27,020 --> 02:34:29,020
You have to say yes when you want to do it.

2200
02:34:29,020 --> 02:34:31,020
When you get home, you have to say yes.

2201
02:34:31,020 --> 02:34:32,020
Do you want to do it?

2202
02:34:32,020 --> 02:34:33,020
Let's do it.

2203
02:34:36,020 --> 02:34:37,020
Oh, no.

2204
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:38,020
I have to go to the bathroom.

2205
02:34:39,020 --> 02:34:40,020
See you.

2206
02:34:41,020 --> 02:34:43,020
Kenji, you have to go to school, too.

2207
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:45,020
Where did I put my clothes?

2208
02:34:48,020 --> 02:34:49,020
See you.

2209
02:34:50,020 --> 02:34:51,020
Have a good day.

2210
02:34:51,020 --> 02:34:53,020
Kenji, you have to get up.

2211
02:34:54,020 --> 02:34:55,020
See you.

2212
02:34:55,020 --> 02:34:56,020
When you get home.

2213
02:35:00,020 --> 02:35:03,020
When I want to do it, I do it.

2214
02:35:04,020 --> 02:35:07,020
When I'm satisfied, I do it.

2215
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:11,020
You're amazing.

2216
02:35:12,020 --> 02:35:13,020
You're amazing.

2217
02:35:14,020 --> 02:35:16,020
I can't stand it.

2218
02:35:21,020 --> 02:35:22,020
Ah!

2219
02:35:37,020 --> 02:35:38,020
No!

2220
02:35:38,020 --> 02:35:39,020
Not yet!

2221
02:35:41,020 --> 02:35:42,020
No!

2222
02:35:42,020 --> 02:35:43,020
I can't do it.

2223
02:35:46,020 --> 02:35:47,020
I can't do it.

2224
02:35:51,020 --> 02:35:57,020
Did you say it?

2225
02:35:57,020 --> 02:36:03,020
I can't believe it.

2226
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:05,020
I said no.

2227
02:36:05,020 --> 02:36:07,020
It's too early.

2228
02:36:07,020 --> 02:36:09,020
I can't help it.

2229
02:36:09,020 --> 02:36:14,020
It's too early.

2230
02:36:14,020 --> 02:36:25,020
I said no.

2231
02:36:25,020 --> 02:36:27,020
Go home.

2232
02:36:27,020 --> 02:36:31,020
I said no.

2233
02:36:31,020 --> 02:36:32,020
It's too early.

2234
02:36:32,020 --> 02:36:37,020
Go home.

2235
02:36:37,020 --> 02:36:39,020
I can't believe it.

2236
02:36:44,020 --> 02:36:46,020
I'm so tired.

2237
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:53,020
I thought I could do this and that.

2238
02:36:58,020 --> 02:37:00,020
I'm home.

2239
02:37:01,020 --> 02:37:03,020
Welcome home.

2240
02:37:08,020 --> 02:37:10,020
I wonder if anyone's home.

2241
02:37:15,020 --> 02:37:17,020
This is no good.

2242
02:37:30,020 --> 02:37:32,020
By the way, my brother was here.

2243
02:37:33,020 --> 02:37:35,020
We're not connected.

2244
02:37:37,020 --> 02:37:39,020
When did he get here?

2245
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:42,020
I'm home.

2246
02:37:43,020 --> 02:37:45,020
I'm so tired.

2247
02:37:46,020 --> 02:37:48,020
Get out of the way.

2248
02:37:51,020 --> 02:37:52,020
You drank a lot.

2249
02:37:53,020 --> 02:37:56,020
The beer was so strong.

2250
02:37:57,020 --> 02:38:01,020
By the way, your brother was here.

2251
02:38:02,020 --> 02:38:04,020
What was his name?

2252
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:06,020
Shunsuke.

2253
02:38:07,020 --> 02:38:09,020
It's been three months.

2254
02:38:10,020 --> 02:38:11,020
Is that so?

2255
02:38:12,020 --> 02:38:13,020
Shunsuke?

2256
02:38:14,020 --> 02:38:16,020
Yes, Shunsuke.

2257
02:38:17,020 --> 02:38:19,020
Get along with him.

2258
02:38:21,020 --> 02:38:25,020
Shunsuke and I are not connected.

2259
02:38:26,020 --> 02:38:28,020
That's right.

2260
02:38:29,020 --> 02:38:31,020
What are you talking about?

2261
02:38:31,020 --> 02:38:35,020
Shunsuke is my father's son.

2262
02:38:36,020 --> 02:38:38,020
You are my daughter.

2263
02:38:39,020 --> 02:38:41,020
Are you okay?

2264
02:38:42,020 --> 02:38:44,020
I'm fine.

2265
02:38:45,020 --> 02:38:51,020
Can blood-related siblings get married?

2266
02:38:52,020 --> 02:38:53,020
What?

2267
02:38:54,020 --> 02:38:57,020
I have a friend like that.

2268
02:38:58,020 --> 02:39:01,020
I'm worried about the other person's brother.

2269
02:39:03,020 --> 02:39:06,020
I'm worried about that kind of relationship.

2270
02:39:07,020 --> 02:39:10,020
I don't think it's a problem.

2271
02:39:11,020 --> 02:39:12,020
Is that so?

2272
02:39:13,020 --> 02:39:14,020
Don't think about weird things.

2273
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:16,020
It's not me.

2274
02:39:17,020 --> 02:39:20,020
I thought you were home.

2275
02:39:20,020 --> 02:39:22,020
Do you think I would do that?

2276
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:24,020
I haven't seen it yet.

2277
02:39:25,020 --> 02:39:26,020
I don't know.

2278
02:39:27,020 --> 02:39:28,020
I don't trust you.

2279
02:39:29,020 --> 02:39:31,020
It's a friend's story.

2280
02:39:32,020 --> 02:39:35,020
I don't know anything.

2281
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:39,020
Is that girl okay?

2282
02:39:50,020 --> 02:39:51,020
I don't know.

2283
02:40:15,020 --> 02:40:16,020
Sit down.

2284
02:40:17,020 --> 02:40:18,020
Let's talk.

2285
02:40:18,020 --> 02:40:19,020
Okay.

2286
02:40:20,020 --> 02:40:21,020
Sit here.

2287
02:40:22,020 --> 02:40:23,020
Don't sit far away.

2288
02:40:25,020 --> 02:40:28,020
We haven't talked to each other for a long time.

2289
02:40:29,020 --> 02:40:30,020
That's right.

2290
02:40:31,020 --> 02:40:32,020
I'm busy.

2291
02:40:33,020 --> 02:40:35,020
I have a lot of work.

2292
02:40:36,020 --> 02:40:37,020
I'm not at home.

2293
02:40:39,020 --> 02:40:40,020
That's right.

2294
02:40:41,020 --> 02:40:42,020
Are you OO?

2295
02:40:43,020 --> 02:40:44,020
I'm OO.

2296
02:40:45,020 --> 02:40:46,020
Are you wearing OO uniform?

2297
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:48,020
That's right.

2298
02:40:49,020 --> 02:40:50,020
How many years have you been studying?

2299
02:40:51,020 --> 02:40:52,020
I've been studying for three years.

2300
02:40:53,020 --> 02:40:54,020
I see.

2301
02:40:55,020 --> 02:40:56,020
Are you an entrance exam student?

2302
02:40:57,020 --> 02:40:58,020
That's right.

2303
02:40:59,020 --> 02:41:00,020
Are you studying?

2304
02:41:01,020 --> 02:41:02,020
I'm studying a little.

2305
02:41:03,020 --> 02:41:04,020
Are you in a club?

2306
02:41:05,020 --> 02:41:06,020
I'm not in a club.

2307
02:41:06,020 --> 02:41:07,020
Are you in a club?

2308
02:41:08,020 --> 02:41:09,020
You don't have any muscles.

2309
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:11,020
That's right.

2310
02:41:14,020 --> 02:41:15,020
Is school fun?

2311
02:41:16,020 --> 02:41:17,020
It's fun.

2312
02:41:18,020 --> 02:41:19,020
Do you have a girlfriend?

2313
02:41:20,020 --> 02:41:21,020
I have a girlfriend.

2314
02:41:22,020 --> 02:41:23,020
Do you have a girlfriend?

2315
02:41:24,020 --> 02:41:25,020
I have a girlfriend.

2316
02:41:26,020 --> 02:41:27,020
I see.

2317
02:41:30,020 --> 02:41:31,020
How long have you been dating?

2318
02:41:32,020 --> 02:41:34,020
About six months.

2319
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:35,020
I think it's been a long time.

2320
02:41:36,020 --> 02:41:37,020
I see.

2321
02:41:38,020 --> 02:41:39,020
It's been six months.

2322
02:41:40,020 --> 02:41:41,020
You've just started dating.

2323
02:41:42,020 --> 02:41:43,020
I think so.

2324
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:45,020
It's been a long time.

2325
02:41:46,020 --> 02:41:47,020
You are popular, aren't you?

2326
02:41:48,020 --> 02:41:49,020
Don't you have a girlfriend?

2327
02:41:50,020 --> 02:41:51,020
I don't have a girlfriend.

2328
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:53,020
You're lying.

2329
02:41:54,020 --> 02:41:55,020
You're going to be told off.

2330
02:41:56,020 --> 02:41:57,020
I don't have a girlfriend.

2331
02:41:58,020 --> 02:41:59,020
You don't have a girlfriend.

2332
02:42:00,020 --> 02:42:01,020
I don't have a girlfriend.

2333
02:42:02,020 --> 02:42:03,020
Don't you want a girlfriend?

2334
02:42:04,020 --> 02:42:05,020
I don't have a girlfriend.

2335
02:42:06,020 --> 02:42:07,020
You want a girlfriend, don't you?

2336
02:42:08,020 --> 02:42:09,020
You want a girlfriend, don't you?

2337
02:42:10,020 --> 02:42:13,020
I don't know how to find a girlfriend.

2338
02:42:14,020 --> 02:42:17,020
Do you have a dating app?

2339
02:42:18,020 --> 02:42:20,020
I can't do that because I'm a woman.

2340
02:42:21,020 --> 02:42:22,020
You're serious.

2341
02:42:23,020 --> 02:42:29,020
I think there are people who want to have a girlfriend.

2342
02:42:30,020 --> 02:42:31,020
Do you think so?

2343
02:42:32,020 --> 02:42:33,020
I think there are people who want to have a girlfriend.

2344
02:42:34,020 --> 02:42:36,020
I'm close to you.

2345
02:42:37,020 --> 02:42:43,020
I'm close to you because you don't notice me.

2346
02:42:44,020 --> 02:42:46,020
What are you talking about?

2347
02:42:47,020 --> 02:42:48,020
What's wrong with you?

2348
02:42:49,020 --> 02:42:50,020
I'm sorry.

2349
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:55,020
Did you get bigger when you talked about it?

2350
02:42:56,020 --> 02:42:57,020
I got bigger when I touched you.

2351
02:42:58,020 --> 02:43:00,020
You're cute.

2352
02:43:04,020 --> 02:43:05,020
I'm sorry.

2353
02:43:10,020 --> 02:43:11,020
What are you talking about?

2354
02:43:12,020 --> 02:43:15,020
I'm close to you.

2355
02:43:16,020 --> 02:43:18,020
But we are siblings.

2356
02:43:19,020 --> 02:43:21,020
It's okay. We are not blood-related.

2357
02:43:27,020 --> 02:43:29,020
Your mother came home.

2358
02:43:30,020 --> 02:43:31,020
My mother?

2359
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:32,020
I don't think so.

2360
02:43:33,020 --> 02:43:35,020
She went out with me because she had something to talk about.

2361
02:43:36,020 --> 02:43:37,020
Is that so?

2362
02:43:40,020 --> 02:43:42,020
I don't think she'll be back in 15 minutes.

2363
02:43:43,020 --> 02:43:47,020
Besides, it's thrilling.

2364
02:43:48,020 --> 02:43:49,020
But...

2365
02:43:50,020 --> 02:43:52,020
I can't do this with my girlfriend.

2366
02:43:53,020 --> 02:43:54,020
I see.

2367
02:43:58,020 --> 02:43:59,020
Are you going to do it here?

2368
02:43:59,020 --> 02:44:00,020
No?

2369
02:44:01,020 --> 02:44:02,020
You don't want to?

2370
02:44:03,020 --> 02:44:05,020
No, I don't want to.

2371
02:44:06,020 --> 02:44:08,020
You want it, don't you?

2372
02:44:30,020 --> 02:44:33,020
You're sweating.

2373
02:44:35,020 --> 02:44:37,020
I'm not sweating.

2374
02:44:42,020 --> 02:44:44,020
It feels good.

2375
02:44:55,020 --> 02:44:57,020
Do you like here?

2376
02:44:57,020 --> 02:44:58,020
Do you like it?

2377
02:44:59,020 --> 02:45:00,020
It's my first time.

2378
02:45:01,020 --> 02:45:02,020
Really?

2379
02:45:03,020 --> 02:45:04,020
You're cute.

2380
02:45:13,020 --> 02:45:14,020
Oh, my God.

2381
02:45:15,020 --> 02:45:17,020
You're sweating a lot.

2382
02:45:18,020 --> 02:45:19,020
A little more.

2383
02:45:27,020 --> 02:45:28,020
It's hot.

2384
02:45:54,020 --> 02:45:55,020
You're bleeding.

2385
02:45:55,020 --> 02:45:56,020
It's hot.

2386
02:45:57,020 --> 02:45:58,020
I'm sorry.

2387
02:46:18,020 --> 02:46:19,020
You're sweating a lot.

2388
02:46:26,020 --> 02:46:27,020
You don't want to?

2389
02:46:28,020 --> 02:46:30,020
No, I don't want to.

2390
02:46:31,020 --> 02:46:32,020
You don't want to?

2391
02:46:35,020 --> 02:46:36,020
I'm sorry.

2392
02:46:37,020 --> 02:46:38,020
I'm sorry.

2393
02:46:51,020 --> 02:46:54,020
I'm sure I'm better than her.

2394
02:46:56,020 --> 02:46:59,020
I'm sure I'm better than her.

2395
02:47:06,020 --> 02:47:07,020
Oh, my God.

2396
02:47:18,020 --> 02:47:19,020
I'm sorry.

2397
02:47:26,020 --> 02:47:27,020
It's hot.

2398
02:47:31,020 --> 02:47:32,020
It feels good.

2399
02:47:41,020 --> 02:47:43,020
I don't have time to do this.

2400
02:47:44,020 --> 02:47:46,020
I want to lick you all the time.

2401
02:47:52,020 --> 02:47:53,020
Lick me, too.

2402
02:47:56,020 --> 02:47:57,020
Yeah.

2403
02:48:09,020 --> 02:48:10,020
It feels good.

2404
02:48:19,020 --> 02:48:20,020
It feels good.

2405
02:48:25,020 --> 02:48:26,020
It's hot.

2406
02:48:55,020 --> 02:48:56,020
It's hot.

2407
02:49:02,020 --> 02:49:03,020
It's hot, isn't it?

2408
02:49:04,020 --> 02:49:05,020
It's hot.

2409
02:49:14,020 --> 02:49:15,020
It feels good.

2410
02:49:16,020 --> 02:49:17,020
I'm touching you.

2411
02:49:19,020 --> 02:49:21,020
I'm sweating a lot.

2412
02:49:25,020 --> 02:49:26,020
It's hot, isn't it?

2413
02:49:27,020 --> 02:49:28,020
It's hot.

2414
02:49:56,020 --> 02:49:57,020
It's hot.

2415
02:50:06,020 --> 02:50:07,020
I can't do this.

2416
02:50:10,020 --> 02:50:11,020
It feels good.

2417
02:50:26,020 --> 02:50:27,020
I can't do this.

2418
02:50:52,020 --> 02:50:53,020
It feels good.

2419
02:50:55,020 --> 02:50:56,020
It's hot.

2420
02:51:17,020 --> 02:51:18,020
Oh, my God.

2421
02:51:25,020 --> 02:51:26,020
I can't do this.

2422
02:51:56,020 --> 02:51:57,020
Oh, my God.

2423
02:52:01,020 --> 02:52:02,020
I can't do this.

2424
02:52:04,020 --> 02:52:05,020
It feels good.

2425
02:52:09,020 --> 02:52:10,020
It feels good.

2426
02:52:23,020 --> 02:52:24,020
I can't do this.

2427
02:52:25,020 --> 02:52:26,020
I can't do this.

2428
02:52:44,020 --> 02:52:45,020
It's hot.

2429
02:52:45,020 --> 02:52:46,020
It's hot.

2430
02:52:46,020 --> 02:52:47,020
Touch me.

2431
02:52:55,020 --> 02:52:56,020
Touch me.

2432
02:53:01,020 --> 02:53:02,020
It feels good.

2433
02:53:06,020 --> 02:53:07,020
Does it feel good?

2434
02:53:09,020 --> 02:53:10,020
I feel good, too.

2435
02:53:14,020 --> 02:53:15,020
I can't do this.

2436
02:53:15,020 --> 02:53:16,020
I can't do this.

2437
02:53:16,020 --> 02:53:17,020
I'm sweating a lot.

2438
02:53:18,020 --> 02:53:19,020
It's hot.

2439
02:53:19,020 --> 02:53:20,020
It's hot.

2440
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:27,020
It's hot.

2441
02:53:35,020 --> 02:53:36,020
I can't do this.

2442
02:53:36,020 --> 02:53:37,020
I can't do this yet.

2443
02:53:39,020 --> 02:53:40,020
I want to do this more.

2444
02:53:41,020 --> 02:53:42,020
Take your time.

2445
02:53:46,020 --> 02:53:47,020
It feels good.

2446
02:53:55,020 --> 02:53:56,020
I can't do this.

2447
02:54:00,020 --> 02:54:01,020
It feels good.

2448
02:54:06,020 --> 02:54:07,020
I can't do this.

2449
02:54:11,020 --> 02:54:12,020
I can't do this.

2450
02:54:25,020 --> 02:54:26,020
I can't do this.

2451
02:54:29,020 --> 02:54:30,020
I'm sweating a lot.

2452
02:54:33,020 --> 02:54:34,020
It's hot.

2453
02:54:40,020 --> 02:54:41,020
I can't do this.

2454
02:54:45,020 --> 02:54:46,020
I'm sweating a lot.

2455
02:54:52,020 --> 02:54:53,020
I'm sweating a lot.

2456
02:54:55,020 --> 02:54:56,020
I'm sweating a lot.

2457
02:54:57,020 --> 02:54:58,020
I'm sorry.

2458
02:54:58,020 --> 02:54:59,020
It feels good.

2459
02:55:02,020 --> 02:55:03,020
I'll make you clean.

2460
02:55:05,020 --> 02:55:06,020
It feels good.

2461
02:55:15,020 --> 02:55:16,020
You're clean.

2462
02:55:18,020 --> 02:55:19,020
Can you do this more?

2463
02:55:20,020 --> 02:55:22,020
My mom will come back.

2464
02:55:22,020 --> 02:55:23,020
I can't do this.

2465
02:55:25,020 --> 02:55:26,020
I can't do this.

2466
02:55:27,020 --> 02:55:28,020
I'll make you clean.

2467
02:55:38,020 --> 02:55:39,020
I'm back.

2468
02:55:40,020 --> 02:55:41,020
Welcome back.

2469
02:55:41,020 --> 02:55:42,020
Welcome back.

2470
02:55:42,020 --> 02:55:43,020
Welcome back.

2471
02:55:50,020 --> 02:55:51,020
Welcome back.

2472
02:55:53,020 --> 02:55:54,020
What were you two doing?

2473
02:55:54,020 --> 02:55:55,020
We were talking.

2474
02:55:56,020 --> 02:55:57,020
Really?

2475
02:55:58,020 --> 02:55:59,020
I'm sorry.

2476
02:55:59,020 --> 02:56:01,020
I shouldn't have said that.

2477
02:56:01,020 --> 02:56:02,020
It's okay.

2478
02:56:02,020 --> 02:56:03,020
We're friends.

2479
02:56:05,020 --> 02:56:06,020
What's that?

2480
02:56:09,020 --> 02:56:10,020
What happened?

2481
02:56:12,020 --> 02:56:13,020
We were eating sweets.

2482
02:56:14,020 --> 02:56:15,020
You should've told me.

2483
02:56:15,020 --> 02:56:16,020
I'm sorry.

2484
02:56:16,020 --> 02:56:17,020
I'll tell you.

2485
02:56:19,020 --> 02:56:20,020
Are you okay?

2486
02:56:20,020 --> 02:56:21,020
Do you know how to do this?

2487
02:56:22,020 --> 02:56:23,020
Yes.

2488
02:56:23,020 --> 02:56:25,020
This is a revenge, so I'm fine.

2489
02:56:31,020 --> 02:56:32,020
You're studying hard.

2490
02:56:35,020 --> 02:56:37,020
If you don't know how to do this, I'll teach you.

2491
02:56:37,020 --> 02:56:38,020
I'll teach you.

2492
02:56:39,020 --> 02:56:42,020
You haven't taught me at all.

2493
02:56:45,020 --> 02:56:46,020
Is that so?

2494
02:56:47,020 --> 02:56:51,020
I can study by myself, so don't teach me.

2495
02:56:53,020 --> 02:56:55,020
Don't say that.

2496
02:56:57,020 --> 02:57:00,020
This is useless in society.

2497
02:57:01,020 --> 02:57:04,020
But I have to study for the entrance exam.

2498
02:57:04,020 --> 02:57:06,020
You're serious.

2499
02:57:07,020 --> 02:57:08,020
I'll teach you.

2500
02:57:13,020 --> 02:57:18,020
But I'll teach you something better than studying.

2501
02:57:20,020 --> 02:57:21,020
That's...

2502
02:57:38,020 --> 02:57:41,020
I just did it.

2503
02:57:41,020 --> 02:57:42,020
It's okay.

2504
02:57:44,020 --> 02:57:46,020
We're a couple, right?

2505
02:57:47,020 --> 02:57:48,020
Is that okay?

2506
02:57:48,020 --> 02:57:49,020
Isn't it?

2507
02:57:50,020 --> 02:57:52,020
You have a girlfriend, but you're with me.

2508
02:57:53,020 --> 02:57:55,020
That's right.

2509
02:57:56,020 --> 02:58:00,020
I want to do it when I want to do it.

2510
02:58:03,020 --> 02:58:06,020
You'll answer me, right?

2511
02:58:06,020 --> 02:58:07,020
Is that so?

2512
02:58:08,020 --> 02:58:09,020
Isn't it?

2513
02:58:10,020 --> 02:58:12,020
You don't have a right to refuse.

2514
02:58:13,020 --> 02:58:14,020
I see.

2515
02:58:15,020 --> 02:58:16,020
Come on.

2516
02:58:17,020 --> 02:58:19,020
I want to do it.

2517
02:58:20,020 --> 02:58:21,020
What should I do?

2518
02:58:30,020 --> 02:58:34,020
You're younger than me, right?

2519
02:58:35,020 --> 02:58:39,020
I'm older than you, so I have to listen to you.

2520
02:58:40,020 --> 02:58:43,020
But brothers don't usually do this.

2521
02:58:44,020 --> 02:58:45,020
Shut up.

2522
02:58:51,020 --> 02:58:54,020
I want to do it, so I'll do it.

2523
02:59:05,020 --> 02:59:08,020
Don't bite me like that.

2524
02:59:08,020 --> 02:59:10,020
You're getting bigger.

2525
02:59:11,020 --> 02:59:15,020
I'll make you feel better.

2526
02:59:30,020 --> 02:59:31,020
That's great.

2527
02:59:35,020 --> 02:59:36,020
That's great.

2528
02:59:45,020 --> 02:59:48,020
Mom, I'm back from shopping.

2529
02:59:49,020 --> 02:59:54,020
I'm making rice now, so I have plenty of time.

2530
02:59:55,020 --> 02:59:56,020
Okay.

2531
03:00:04,020 --> 03:00:05,020
It's hot.

2532
03:00:08,020 --> 03:00:10,020
It feels good.

2533
03:00:34,020 --> 03:00:36,020
Does it feel good?

2534
03:00:37,020 --> 03:00:39,020
It feels good.

2535
03:00:40,020 --> 03:00:42,020
Does it feel good?

2536
03:00:44,020 --> 03:00:45,020
It feels good.

2537
03:00:59,020 --> 03:01:00,020
That's great.

2538
03:01:09,020 --> 03:01:10,020
It's hot.

2539
03:01:14,020 --> 03:01:16,020
You're sweating a lot.

2540
03:01:28,020 --> 03:01:30,020
Do you lick such a place?

2541
03:01:31,020 --> 03:01:32,020
Do you like it here?

2542
03:01:34,020 --> 03:01:35,020
It feels good.

2543
03:01:39,020 --> 03:01:40,020
It feels good.

2544
03:02:10,020 --> 03:02:12,020
You think it feels good, don't you?

2545
03:02:16,020 --> 03:02:18,020
You want to do it.

2546
03:02:23,020 --> 03:02:24,020
It feels good.

2547
03:02:40,020 --> 03:02:43,020
I'm going to do something she hasn't done.

2548
03:02:52,020 --> 03:02:54,020
You're so soft.

2549
03:03:10,020 --> 03:03:12,020
That's great.

2550
03:03:14,020 --> 03:03:15,020
It feels good.

2551
03:03:16,020 --> 03:03:17,020
Does it feel good?

2552
03:03:29,020 --> 03:03:30,020
How do you feel?

2553
03:03:31,020 --> 03:03:33,020
You want to do it, don't you?

2554
03:03:34,020 --> 03:03:35,020
I want to do it.

2555
03:03:36,020 --> 03:03:38,020
You can't do it yet.

2556
03:03:39,020 --> 03:03:40,020
I can't do it.

2557
03:03:43,020 --> 03:03:44,020
You don't want to do it?

2558
03:03:45,020 --> 03:03:46,020
I want to do it.

2559
03:03:50,020 --> 03:03:52,020
I'm not going to do it yet.

2560
03:03:53,020 --> 03:03:54,020
I can't do it.

2561
03:03:56,020 --> 03:03:57,020
You can't do it yet.

2562
03:03:58,020 --> 03:04:00,020
You can't do it faster.

2563
03:04:10,020 --> 03:04:11,020
It's hot.

2564
03:04:16,020 --> 03:04:17,020
Does it feel good?

2565
03:04:19,020 --> 03:04:20,020
It feels good.

2566
03:04:25,020 --> 03:04:26,020
You can't do it yet.

2567
03:04:27,020 --> 03:04:29,020
I want you to feel good about me.

2568
03:04:37,020 --> 03:04:38,020
Touch me.

2569
03:04:39,020 --> 03:04:40,020
Okay.

2570
03:04:51,020 --> 03:04:56,020
I got excited when you licked me.

2571
03:04:59,020 --> 03:05:00,020
I'm going to put my fingers in.

2572
03:05:00,020 --> 03:05:01,020
It feels good, doesn't it?

2573
03:05:14,020 --> 03:05:15,020
Touch me more.

2574
03:05:24,020 --> 03:05:25,020
It feels good.

2575
03:05:27,020 --> 03:05:28,020
Here?

2576
03:05:30,020 --> 03:05:31,020
It feels good.

2577
03:05:34,020 --> 03:05:35,020
That's good.

2578
03:05:51,020 --> 03:05:53,020
Hey, lick me.

2579
03:06:01,020 --> 03:06:02,020
Ah.

2580
03:06:04,020 --> 03:06:05,020
Ah.

2581
03:06:07,020 --> 03:06:08,020
Ah.

2582
03:06:09,020 --> 03:06:10,020
Ah.

2583
03:06:11,020 --> 03:06:12,020
Ah.

2584
03:06:14,020 --> 03:06:15,020
Oh, no.

2585
03:06:16,020 --> 03:06:17,020
It feels good.

2586
03:06:21,020 --> 03:06:22,020
Ah.

2587
03:06:24,020 --> 03:06:28,020
You're good at licking me.

2588
03:06:30,020 --> 03:06:31,020
Ah.

2589
03:06:32,020 --> 03:06:33,020
Ah.

2590
03:06:39,020 --> 03:06:40,020
Lick me more.

2591
03:06:42,020 --> 03:06:43,020
Ah.

2592
03:06:44,020 --> 03:06:45,020
Ah.

2593
03:06:46,020 --> 03:06:47,020
Ah.

2594
03:06:48,020 --> 03:06:49,020
Ah.

2595
03:06:50,020 --> 03:06:51,020
Ah.

2596
03:06:52,020 --> 03:06:53,020
It feels good.

2597
03:06:54,020 --> 03:06:55,020
Ah.

2598
03:06:56,020 --> 03:06:57,020
Ah.

2599
03:06:57,020 --> 03:06:58,020
Ah.

2600
03:06:59,020 --> 03:07:00,020
Ah.

2601
03:07:01,020 --> 03:07:02,020
Ouch.

2602
03:07:04,020 --> 03:07:05,020
Ah.

2603
03:07:06,020 --> 03:07:07,020
Ah.

2604
03:07:09,020 --> 03:07:10,020
Ah.

2605
03:07:11,020 --> 03:07:12,020
Ah.

2606
03:07:14,020 --> 03:07:15,020
Ah.

2607
03:07:18,020 --> 03:07:19,020
I can't stand it anymore.

2608
03:07:21,020 --> 03:07:22,020
Let's do it.

2609
03:07:28,020 --> 03:07:29,020
It's okay.

2610
03:07:30,020 --> 03:07:31,020
Don't worry about it.

2611
03:07:32,020 --> 03:07:33,020
Ah.

2612
03:07:34,020 --> 03:07:35,020
Ah.

2613
03:07:42,020 --> 03:07:43,020
It feels good.

2614
03:07:44,020 --> 03:07:45,020
Oh, no.

2615
03:07:50,020 --> 03:07:51,020
Ah.

2616
03:07:52,020 --> 03:07:53,020
Ah.

2617
03:07:54,020 --> 03:07:55,020
Ah.

2618
03:07:55,020 --> 03:07:56,020
Ah.

2619
03:07:56,020 --> 03:07:57,020
Ah.

2620
03:07:58,020 --> 03:07:59,020
Ah.

2621
03:07:59,020 --> 03:08:00,020
It feels good.

2622
03:08:01,020 --> 03:08:02,020
Ah.

2623
03:08:02,020 --> 03:08:03,020
Ah.

2624
03:08:03,020 --> 03:08:04,020
Ah.

2625
03:08:04,020 --> 03:08:05,020
Ah.

2626
03:08:05,020 --> 03:08:06,020
Ah.

2627
03:08:06,020 --> 03:08:07,020
Ah.

2628
03:08:07,020 --> 03:08:08,020
Ah.

2629
03:08:08,020 --> 03:08:09,020
Ah.

2630
03:08:09,020 --> 03:08:10,020
Ah.

2631
03:08:10,020 --> 03:08:11,020
Ah.

2632
03:08:11,020 --> 03:08:12,020
Ah.

2633
03:08:12,020 --> 03:08:13,020
Ah.

2634
03:08:13,020 --> 03:08:14,020
It's hard.

2635
03:08:15,020 --> 03:08:16,020
Ah.

2636
03:08:16,020 --> 03:08:17,020
Ah.

2637
03:08:18,020 --> 03:08:19,020
Ouch.

2638
03:08:19,020 --> 03:08:20,020
Ah.

2639
03:08:20,020 --> 03:08:21,020
Ah.

2640
03:08:21,020 --> 03:08:22,020
Ah.

2641
03:08:22,020 --> 03:08:26,020
If you speak too loudly, my mom might hear you.

2642
03:08:26,020 --> 03:08:27,020
Ah.

2643
03:08:27,020 --> 03:08:28,020
Ah.

2644
03:08:28,020 --> 03:08:29,020
Ah.

2645
03:08:29,020 --> 03:08:30,020
You're right.

2646
03:08:30,020 --> 03:08:32,020
I should be careful.

2647
03:08:33,020 --> 03:08:34,020
Ah.

2648
03:08:34,020 --> 03:08:37,020
But it feels good.

2649
03:08:37,020 --> 03:08:38,020
Ah.

2650
03:08:38,020 --> 03:08:40,020
So I speak loudly.

2651
03:08:40,020 --> 03:08:41,020
Ah.

2652
03:08:41,020 --> 03:08:42,020
Ah.

2653
03:08:42,020 --> 03:08:43,020
Ah.

2654
03:08:43,020 --> 03:08:44,020
Ah.

2655
03:08:44,020 --> 03:08:45,020
Ah.

2656
03:08:45,020 --> 03:08:46,020
Ah.

2657
03:08:46,020 --> 03:08:47,020
Ah.

2658
03:08:47,020 --> 03:08:48,020
Ah.

2659
03:08:49,020 --> 03:08:50,020
Ah.

2660
03:08:50,020 --> 03:08:51,020
Ah.

2661
03:08:51,020 --> 03:08:52,020
Ah.

2662
03:08:52,020 --> 03:08:53,020
Ah.

2663
03:08:53,020 --> 03:08:54,020
Ah.

2664
03:08:54,020 --> 03:08:55,020
Ah.

2665
03:08:55,020 --> 03:08:56,020
Ah.

2666
03:08:56,020 --> 03:08:57,020
Ah.

2667
03:08:57,020 --> 03:08:58,020
Ah.

2668
03:08:58,020 --> 03:08:59,020
Ah.

2669
03:08:59,020 --> 03:09:00,020
Ah.

2670
03:09:00,020 --> 03:09:01,020
Ah.

2671
03:09:01,020 --> 03:09:02,020
Ah.

2672
03:09:02,020 --> 03:09:03,020
Ah.

2673
03:09:03,020 --> 03:09:04,020
Ah.

2674
03:09:04,020 --> 03:09:05,020
Ah.

2675
03:09:05,020 --> 03:09:06,020
Ah.

2676
03:09:06,020 --> 03:09:07,020
Ah.

2677
03:09:07,020 --> 03:09:08,020
Ah.

2678
03:09:08,020 --> 03:09:09,020
Ah.

2679
03:09:09,020 --> 03:09:10,020
What?

2680
03:09:10,020 --> 03:09:12,020
The meal is ready.

2681
03:09:12,020 --> 03:09:13,020
Get in.

2682
03:09:13,020 --> 03:09:14,020
Ah.

2683
03:09:14,020 --> 03:09:15,020
Okay.

2684
03:09:18,020 --> 03:09:20,020
What are you doing?

2685
03:09:20,020 --> 03:09:22,020
I was just getting changed.

2686
03:09:22,020 --> 03:09:23,020
Oh, I see.

2687
03:09:23,020 --> 03:09:25,020
I came to pick you up because dinner's ready.

2688
03:09:25,020 --> 03:09:26,020
You're going to eat, right?

2689
03:09:26,020 --> 03:09:28,020
Yeah, I'm going to eat.

2690
03:09:28,020 --> 03:09:29,020
What are you doing?

2691
03:09:29,020 --> 03:09:30,020
No, no, no.

2692
03:09:30,020 --> 03:09:32,020
I was just getting changed.

2693
03:09:32,020 --> 03:09:35,020
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

2694
03:09:35,020 --> 03:09:36,020
What?

2695
03:09:36,020 --> 03:09:38,020
No, I'm not embarrassed in front of a girl.

2696
03:09:38,020 --> 03:09:42,020
Hey, what are you doing?

2697
03:09:42,020 --> 03:09:44,020
What am I doing?

2698
03:09:44,020 --> 03:09:46,020
I was just getting changed.

2699
03:09:46,020 --> 03:09:48,020
What are you doing?

2700
03:09:48,020 --> 03:09:50,020
I came to pick you up because dinner's ready.

2701
03:09:50,020 --> 03:09:52,020
Oh, yeah, that's right.

2702
03:09:52,020 --> 03:09:56,020
Well, there are a lot of things for girls.

2703
03:09:56,020 --> 03:10:00,020
Hey, by the way, do you know Shunsuke?

2704
03:10:00,020 --> 03:10:02,020
What? I don't know.

2705
03:10:02,020 --> 03:10:05,020
I just went to his room, but he wasn't there.

2706
03:10:05,020 --> 03:10:07,020
Didn't you say you'd teach him how to study?

2707
03:10:07,020 --> 03:10:08,020
What?

2708
03:10:08,020 --> 03:10:10,020
I didn't say that.

2709
03:10:10,020 --> 03:10:12,020
Didn't you say you'd take him for a walk?

2710
03:10:12,020 --> 03:10:14,020
I guess so.

2711
03:10:14,020 --> 03:10:16,020
He seems to like to take a walk.

2712
03:10:16,020 --> 03:10:17,020
Is that so?

2713
03:10:17,020 --> 03:10:19,020
Well, dinner's ready, so come on.

2714
03:10:19,020 --> 03:10:21,020
Yeah, I got it.

2715
03:10:26,020 --> 03:10:28,020
Hey, are you really okay?

2716
03:10:28,020 --> 03:10:30,020
Yeah, I'm fine.

2717
03:10:30,020 --> 03:10:32,020
You don't have a stomachache, do you?

2718
03:10:32,020 --> 03:10:34,020
Yeah, I'm fine.

2719
03:10:34,020 --> 03:10:36,020
You told me earlier.

2720
03:10:39,020 --> 03:10:42,020
You're out of breath, but you're not sick, are you?

2721
03:10:42,020 --> 03:10:43,020
I'm fine.

2722
03:10:43,020 --> 03:10:44,020
Really?

2723
03:10:44,020 --> 03:10:46,020
I'm fine. Don't come.

2724
03:10:46,020 --> 03:10:48,020
What are you talking about?

2725
03:10:48,020 --> 03:10:49,020
I'm worried about you.

2726
03:10:49,020 --> 03:10:52,020
I'll be right there, so get out of here.

2727
03:10:52,020 --> 03:10:54,020
You don't look well.

2728
03:10:54,020 --> 03:10:56,020
I'm fine.

2729
03:10:56,020 --> 03:10:58,020
I'll be right there.

2730
03:10:59,020 --> 03:11:01,020
Get out of here.

2731
03:11:05,020 --> 03:11:07,020
Call me if you need anything.

2732
03:11:07,020 --> 03:11:08,020
Yeah.

2733
03:11:13,020 --> 03:11:15,020
I'll be right there.

2734
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:33,020
Hey, what are you doing?

2735
03:11:33,020 --> 03:11:35,020
Mom's here.

2736
03:11:35,020 --> 03:11:39,020
I want to do it when I want to.

2737
03:11:40,020 --> 03:11:42,020
What are you doing?

2738
03:11:42,020 --> 03:11:44,020
I'm sorry.

2739
03:11:52,020 --> 03:11:54,020
How's it going, Tomoi?

2740
03:11:54,020 --> 03:11:56,020
Are you used to living together?

2741
03:11:56,020 --> 03:11:58,020
Yeah, I guess so.

2742
03:11:58,020 --> 03:12:00,020
I'm getting used to it.

2743
03:12:00,020 --> 03:12:05,020
I'm sorry to ask you this all of a sudden.

2744
03:12:05,020 --> 03:12:10,020
I'm happy to have a dad and a sister.

2745
03:12:10,020 --> 03:12:13,020
I'm glad to hear that.

2746
03:12:13,020 --> 03:12:16,020
How's your study going?

2747
03:12:16,020 --> 03:12:20,020
I'm doing pretty well because I have an exam this year.

2748
03:12:20,020 --> 03:12:22,020
I see.

2749
03:12:22,020 --> 03:12:30,020
I might be able to teach you something you don't know.

2750
03:12:31,020 --> 03:12:36,020
If you want me to teach you something, let me know.

2751
03:12:37,020 --> 03:12:39,020
Tomoi.

2752
03:12:39,020 --> 03:12:40,020
Tomoi.

2753
03:12:40,020 --> 03:12:41,020
Yes?

2754
03:12:41,020 --> 03:12:44,020
If you don't know anything, you can ask me.

2755
03:12:44,020 --> 03:12:46,020
You don't know anything?

2756
03:12:46,020 --> 03:12:49,020
You want me to teach you?

2757
03:12:49,020 --> 03:12:51,020
We're family.

2758
03:12:51,020 --> 03:12:53,020
Don't worry about that.

2759
03:12:53,020 --> 03:12:55,020
I see.

2760
03:12:56,020 --> 03:12:57,020
Naomi.

2761
03:12:57,020 --> 03:13:04,020
You didn't do so well in college.

2762
03:13:04,020 --> 03:13:06,020
But you can teach me something, right?

2763
03:13:06,020 --> 03:13:07,020
I see.

2764
03:13:07,020 --> 03:13:11,020
I'm studying for the entrance exam.

2765
03:13:11,020 --> 03:13:13,020
Teach me something.

2766
03:13:13,020 --> 03:13:14,020
I see.

2767
03:13:14,020 --> 03:13:16,020
I said I see.

2768
03:13:16,020 --> 03:13:19,020
You can teach me something, right?

2769
03:13:19,020 --> 03:13:20,020
I see.

2770
03:13:20,020 --> 03:13:22,020
Tomoi.

2771
03:13:22,020 --> 03:13:23,020
Yes?

2772
03:13:23,020 --> 03:13:26,020
Ask Naomi to teach you something.

2773
03:13:26,020 --> 03:13:30,020
But she seems busy.

2774
03:13:30,020 --> 03:13:32,020
She's not busy.

2775
03:13:32,020 --> 03:13:35,020
I have a lot of things to do.

2776
03:13:35,020 --> 03:13:37,020
I know.

2777
03:13:37,020 --> 03:13:39,020
I don't think she's at home.

2778
03:13:39,020 --> 03:13:44,020
You should get a job.

2779
03:13:44,020 --> 03:13:45,020
Right, Tomoi?

2780
03:13:45,020 --> 03:13:46,020
What?

2781
03:13:46,020 --> 03:13:51,020
I'm going to college.

2782
03:13:52,020 --> 03:13:55,020
I'm studying for the entrance exam.

2783
03:13:55,020 --> 03:13:56,020
You're family.

2784
03:13:56,020 --> 03:13:58,020
You should study hard.

2785
03:13:58,020 --> 03:14:00,020
I see.

2786
03:14:00,020 --> 03:14:03,020
I'm going to work.

2787
03:14:03,020 --> 03:14:05,020
See you later.

2788
03:14:05,020 --> 03:14:08,020
Can you clean up here?

2789
03:14:08,020 --> 03:14:09,020
Okay.

2790
03:14:09,020 --> 03:14:10,020
See you later.

2791
03:14:10,020 --> 03:14:12,020
See you later.

2792
03:14:13,020 --> 03:14:14,020
See you later.

2793
03:14:14,020 --> 03:14:15,020
See you later.

2794
03:14:15,020 --> 03:14:17,020
Bye.

2795
03:14:22,020 --> 03:14:24,020
What?

2796
03:14:36,020 --> 03:14:37,020
Right?

2797
03:14:37,020 --> 03:14:39,020
Yes.

2798
03:14:39,020 --> 03:14:44,020
I can teach you something.

2799
03:14:44,020 --> 03:14:48,020
But she seems busy.

2800
03:14:48,020 --> 03:14:49,020
Really?

2801
03:14:49,020 --> 03:14:52,020
You should study hard.

2802
03:14:54,020 --> 03:14:55,020
What's wrong?

2803
03:14:55,020 --> 03:14:57,020
Nothing.

2804
03:15:02,020 --> 03:15:03,020
What's wrong?

2805
03:15:03,020 --> 03:15:04,020
What?

2806
03:15:05,020 --> 03:15:06,020
Nothing.

2807
03:15:09,020 --> 03:15:13,020
You should have told me earlier.

2808
03:15:13,020 --> 03:15:15,020
What do you mean?

2809
03:15:16,020 --> 03:15:20,020
You stood up when you saw me, didn't you?

2810
03:15:21,020 --> 03:15:22,020
No.

2811
03:15:22,020 --> 03:15:25,020
It's a physiological phenomenon.

2812
03:15:25,020 --> 03:15:28,020
I tend to stand up in the morning.

2813
03:15:28,020 --> 03:15:31,020
But you were looking at my chest.

2814
03:15:32,020 --> 03:15:34,020
I'm sorry.

2815
03:15:34,020 --> 03:15:39,020
I thought you were wearing sexy clothes.

2816
03:15:39,020 --> 03:15:43,020
So, I was worried about you.

2817
03:15:43,020 --> 03:15:48,020
I didn't want you to worry about me.

2818
03:15:48,020 --> 03:15:56,020
But I want you to study hard.

2819
03:15:56,020 --> 03:15:59,020
What do you mean?

2820
03:15:59,020 --> 03:16:01,020
You're my sister.

2821
03:16:01,020 --> 03:16:03,020
You should take care of me.

2822
03:16:03,020 --> 03:16:04,020
Take care of you?

2823
03:16:04,020 --> 03:16:06,020
No.

2824
03:16:06,020 --> 03:16:09,020
It's okay.

2825
03:16:09,020 --> 03:16:10,020
What?

2826
03:16:11,020 --> 03:16:13,020
Oh, right.

2827
03:16:13,020 --> 03:16:15,020
Wait a minute.

2828
03:16:20,020 --> 03:16:22,020
Hello?

2829
03:16:22,020 --> 03:16:23,020
Good morning.

2830
03:16:23,020 --> 03:16:27,020
You said we'd meet at the lab today.

2831
03:16:27,020 --> 03:16:28,020
Lab?

2832
03:16:28,020 --> 03:16:30,020
I'm sorry.

2833
03:16:30,020 --> 03:16:31,020
Cancel it.

2834
03:16:31,020 --> 03:16:33,020
What do you mean?

2835
03:16:33,020 --> 03:16:34,020
I'm scared.

2836
03:16:34,020 --> 03:16:35,020
Can I say it?

2837
03:16:35,020 --> 03:16:36,020
Yes.

2838
03:16:36,020 --> 03:16:39,020
Don't worry.

2839
03:16:40,020 --> 03:16:41,020
Can I?

2840
03:16:41,020 --> 03:16:44,020
Thank you.

2841
03:16:44,020 --> 03:16:46,020
See you.

2842
03:16:46,020 --> 03:16:48,020
See you.

2843
03:16:49,020 --> 03:16:52,020
You had a plan, didn't you?

2844
03:16:52,020 --> 03:16:54,020
It's okay.

2845
03:16:54,020 --> 03:16:55,020
It's my usual plan.

2846
03:16:55,020 --> 03:16:59,020
Do you have a boyfriend?

2847
03:16:59,020 --> 03:17:00,020
I don't have a boyfriend.

2848
03:17:00,020 --> 03:17:01,020
I have another boyfriend.

2849
03:17:01,020 --> 03:17:02,020
Another?

2850
03:17:02,020 --> 03:17:03,020
He's my boyfriend.

2851
03:17:03,020 --> 03:17:04,020
Boyfriend?

2852
03:17:04,020 --> 03:17:09,020
I'm tired of taking the train and walking.

2853
03:17:09,020 --> 03:17:13,020
Because I have a boyfriend here.

2854
03:17:13,020 --> 03:17:14,020
What?

2855
03:17:16,020 --> 03:17:19,020
Let's go to school after this.

2856
03:17:19,020 --> 03:17:22,020
I have to go to school.

2857
03:17:22,020 --> 03:17:24,020
You can't go to school if you don't have a boyfriend.

2858
03:17:24,020 --> 03:17:25,020
What?

2859
03:17:25,020 --> 03:17:28,020
Let's go to school.

2860
03:17:28,020 --> 03:17:29,020
What?

2861
03:17:34,020 --> 03:17:36,020
Let's go to school.

2862
03:17:36,020 --> 03:17:37,020
Let's go to school.

2863
03:18:01,020 --> 03:18:03,020
What are you doing?

2864
03:18:04,020 --> 03:18:06,020
It's hot.

2865
03:18:08,020 --> 03:18:10,020
Is it okay?

2866
03:18:10,020 --> 03:18:12,020
It's huge.

2867
03:18:12,020 --> 03:18:15,020
Didn't you want to touch it?

2868
03:18:15,020 --> 03:18:17,020
That's...

2869
03:18:17,020 --> 03:18:19,020
Yes.

2870
03:18:19,020 --> 03:18:21,020
I wanted to touch it.

2871
03:18:27,020 --> 03:18:29,020
It's amazing.

2872
03:18:29,020 --> 03:18:31,020
It's soft.

2873
03:18:32,020 --> 03:18:34,020
It's huge.

2874
03:18:34,020 --> 03:18:36,020
It's beautiful.

2875
03:18:43,020 --> 03:18:45,020
It's beautiful.

2876
03:18:49,020 --> 03:18:51,020
How is it?

2877
03:18:51,020 --> 03:18:57,020
It's soft.

2878
03:18:57,020 --> 03:18:59,020
It's beautiful.

2879
03:18:59,020 --> 03:19:01,020
It's huge.

2880
03:19:01,020 --> 03:19:03,020
It's beautiful.

2881
03:19:09,020 --> 03:19:11,020
You're good at it.

2882
03:19:11,020 --> 03:19:13,020
I'm not good at it.

2883
03:19:29,020 --> 03:19:31,020
You're good at it.

2884
03:19:49,020 --> 03:19:52,020
It's getting bigger and bigger.

2885
03:19:59,020 --> 03:20:01,020
It's getting bigger and bigger.

2886
03:20:05,020 --> 03:20:07,020
It's getting bigger and bigger.

2887
03:20:11,020 --> 03:20:13,020
I'm embarrassed.

2888
03:20:13,020 --> 03:20:14,020
Why?

2889
03:20:14,020 --> 03:20:16,020
It's okay.

2890
03:20:19,020 --> 03:20:21,020
You can't get your uniform dirty.

2891
03:20:21,020 --> 03:20:22,020
That's right.

2892
03:20:22,020 --> 03:20:24,020
We're going to school.

2893
03:20:30,020 --> 03:20:32,020
Wow.

2894
03:20:32,020 --> 03:20:34,020
You're good at it.

2895
03:20:34,020 --> 03:20:36,020
Naomi.

2896
03:20:38,020 --> 03:20:40,020
You're good at it.

2897
03:20:42,020 --> 03:20:44,020
But...

2898
03:20:44,020 --> 03:20:47,020
We're siblings.

2899
03:20:47,020 --> 03:20:49,020
We should stop it.

2900
03:20:49,020 --> 03:20:51,020
We're siblings.

2901
03:20:51,020 --> 03:20:53,020
Should we stop it?

2902
03:20:53,020 --> 03:20:55,020
No.

2903
03:20:56,020 --> 03:21:00,020
Even if we're siblings, our blood doesn't connect.

2904
03:21:00,020 --> 03:21:02,020
That's right.

2905
03:21:04,020 --> 03:21:06,020
We can't stop it.

2906
03:21:12,020 --> 03:21:14,020
How do you feel?

2907
03:21:19,020 --> 03:21:21,020
How do you feel?

2908
03:21:22,020 --> 03:21:24,020
I don't like it.

2909
03:21:33,020 --> 03:21:35,020
It's not good.

2910
03:21:38,020 --> 03:21:40,020
How about this?

2911
03:21:52,020 --> 03:21:54,020
It's not good.

2912
03:22:04,020 --> 03:22:06,020
How do you feel?

2913
03:22:06,020 --> 03:22:08,020
It's not good.

2914
03:22:22,020 --> 03:22:24,020
It's not good.

2915
03:22:47,020 --> 03:22:49,020
I see.

2916
03:22:49,020 --> 03:22:51,020
I don't have time.

2917
03:22:53,020 --> 03:22:55,020
I'm happy, so I'm nervous.

2918
03:22:59,020 --> 03:23:01,020
You can touch me.

2919
03:23:03,020 --> 03:23:04,020
Really?

2920
03:23:04,020 --> 03:23:05,020
Yes.

2921
03:23:14,020 --> 03:23:16,020
Naomi.

2922
03:23:19,020 --> 03:23:21,020
It's hot.

2923
03:23:21,020 --> 03:23:23,020
It's hot.

2924
03:23:23,020 --> 03:23:25,020
It's amazing.

2925
03:23:25,020 --> 03:23:27,020
It's wet.

2926
03:23:27,020 --> 03:23:29,020
It's wet.

2927
03:23:29,020 --> 03:23:31,020
Are you already wet?

2928
03:23:31,020 --> 03:23:33,020
It's wet.

2929
03:23:33,020 --> 03:23:35,020
It's wet.

2930
03:23:35,020 --> 03:23:37,020
It's wet.

2931
03:23:49,020 --> 03:23:51,020
It's wet.

2932
03:23:55,020 --> 03:23:57,020
It's wet.

2933
03:23:57,020 --> 03:23:59,020
It's wet.

2934
03:23:59,020 --> 03:24:01,020
It's wet.

2935
03:24:19,020 --> 03:24:21,020
It's wet.

2936
03:24:49,020 --> 03:24:51,020
It's wet.

2937
03:24:57,020 --> 03:24:59,020
Don't you want to put it in?

2938
03:24:59,020 --> 03:25:01,020
I want to put it in.

2939
03:25:01,020 --> 03:25:03,020
Do you want to put it in?

2940
03:25:03,020 --> 03:25:05,020
Yes.

2941
03:25:19,020 --> 03:25:21,020
It's hot.

2942
03:25:27,020 --> 03:25:29,020
It's hot.

2943
03:25:41,020 --> 03:25:43,020
It's hot.

2944
03:25:43,020 --> 03:25:45,020
It's hot.

2945
03:25:45,020 --> 03:25:47,020
It's hot.

2946
03:25:49,020 --> 03:25:51,020
It's hot.

2947
03:25:53,020 --> 03:25:55,020
It's hot.

2948
03:25:55,020 --> 03:25:57,020
It's hot.

2949
03:26:09,020 --> 03:26:11,020
It's hot.

2950
03:26:19,020 --> 03:26:21,020
It's hot.

2951
03:26:27,020 --> 03:26:29,020
It's hot.

2952
03:26:29,020 --> 03:26:31,020
It's hot.

2953
03:26:39,020 --> 03:26:43,020
I feel like I'm in a good place.

2954
03:26:43,020 --> 03:26:45,020
Me, too.

2955
03:26:45,020 --> 03:26:49,020
I feel good when Naomi laughs.

2956
03:27:15,020 --> 03:27:17,020
It's hot.

2957
03:27:17,020 --> 03:27:19,020
It's hot.

2958
03:27:21,020 --> 03:27:23,020
It's hot.

2959
03:27:29,020 --> 03:27:31,020
It's hot.

2960
03:27:45,020 --> 03:27:47,020
It's hot.

2961
03:27:47,020 --> 03:27:49,020
It's hot.

2962
03:27:51,020 --> 03:27:53,020
It's hot.

2963
03:27:53,020 --> 03:27:55,020
Are you all right?

2964
03:27:59,020 --> 03:28:01,020
You are all right.

2965
03:28:01,020 --> 03:28:03,020
Are you all right?

2966
03:28:07,020 --> 03:28:09,020
It's hot.

2967
03:28:09,020 --> 03:28:11,020
It's hot.

2968
03:28:11,020 --> 03:28:13,020
It's hot.

2969
03:28:15,020 --> 03:28:22,600
Oh...

2970
03:28:25,400 --> 03:28:26,440
I'm sorry.

2971
03:28:29,740 --> 03:28:30,800
I'm sorry.

2972
03:28:30,800 --> 03:28:31,800
It's hot.

2973
03:28:44,800 --> 03:28:45,800
It's hot, isn't it?

2974
03:28:51,800 --> 03:28:53,800
I have to do it cleanly.

2975
03:29:00,800 --> 03:29:02,800
Do you like it?

2976
03:29:04,800 --> 03:29:06,800
I have to prepare meat.

2977
03:29:11,800 --> 03:29:13,800
I'll do the cleaning.

2978
03:29:21,800 --> 03:29:23,800
I'll be back early.

2979
03:29:25,800 --> 03:29:27,800
So come back early.

2980
03:29:27,800 --> 03:29:28,800
Okay.

2981
03:29:29,800 --> 03:29:30,800
See you later.

2982
03:29:32,800 --> 03:29:33,800
Okay, I'll be back.

2983
03:29:34,800 --> 03:29:35,800
Your bag!

2984
03:29:42,800 --> 03:29:43,800
I did it.

2985
03:29:43,800 --> 03:29:45,800
I got Sefre at home.

2986
03:29:47,800 --> 03:29:50,800
I can do it whenever I want.

2987
03:29:57,800 --> 03:30:01,800
I was surprised. I didn't know Naomi would be like that.

2988
03:30:02,800 --> 03:30:07,800
It's awkward. I couldn't say anything when I went home.

2989
03:30:09,800 --> 03:30:10,800
What?

2990
03:30:11,800 --> 03:30:14,800
Oh, you're back.

2991
03:30:15,800 --> 03:30:17,800
You should have told me that you were back.

2992
03:30:21,800 --> 03:30:26,800
I was in a hurry to do my homework, so I forgot to say hello.

2993
03:30:27,800 --> 03:30:31,800
But you said you'd do it when you got home.

2994
03:30:33,800 --> 03:30:38,800
I think I said something like that in the morning.

2995
03:30:39,800 --> 03:30:40,800
Right?

2996
03:30:40,800 --> 03:30:41,800
Yes.

2997
03:30:41,800 --> 03:30:43,800
Then you don't have to do it.

2998
03:30:44,800 --> 03:30:45,800
I'm sorry.

2999
03:30:48,800 --> 03:30:51,800
I want to do it when I want to.

3000
03:30:52,800 --> 03:30:54,800
I want to do it when I want to.

3001
03:30:58,800 --> 03:30:59,800
What?

3002
03:30:59,800 --> 03:31:01,800
But I have to study.

3003
03:31:01,800 --> 03:31:02,800
What?

3004
03:31:02,800 --> 03:31:03,800
I have to take an exam.

3005
03:31:03,800 --> 03:31:04,800
Now?

3006
03:31:05,800 --> 03:31:07,800
I do it when I go to school in the morning.

3007
03:31:08,800 --> 03:31:09,800
Oh, I see.

3008
03:31:10,800 --> 03:31:11,800
It's too late.

3009
03:31:17,800 --> 03:31:18,800
Isn't it cute?

3010
03:31:27,800 --> 03:31:29,800
Let's go to bed.

3011
03:31:58,800 --> 03:32:02,800
You can do this kind of erotic thing every day.

3012
03:32:02,800 --> 03:32:03,800
What?

3013
03:32:03,800 --> 03:32:04,800
Isn't it good?

3014
03:32:05,800 --> 03:32:06,800
That's true.

3015
03:32:18,800 --> 03:32:20,800
Make it bigger.

3016
03:32:20,800 --> 03:32:21,800
I'm sorry.

3017
03:32:27,800 --> 03:32:28,800
I'm sorry.

3018
03:32:47,800 --> 03:32:48,800
You like it, don't you?

3019
03:32:48,800 --> 03:32:49,800
Yes.

3020
03:32:57,800 --> 03:32:58,800
I'm sorry.

3021
03:33:27,800 --> 03:33:28,800
I'm sorry.

3022
03:33:45,800 --> 03:33:46,800
I'm sorry.

3023
03:33:49,800 --> 03:33:51,800
Why are you crying so hard?

3024
03:33:51,800 --> 03:33:52,800
I'm sorry.

3025
03:33:57,800 --> 03:33:58,800
It's big.

3026
03:34:06,800 --> 03:34:08,800
You're making it so hard.

3027
03:34:08,800 --> 03:34:09,800
I'm sorry.

3028
03:34:18,800 --> 03:34:19,800
What do you want to do?

3029
03:34:19,800 --> 03:34:22,800
I want you to eat and play with me.

3030
03:34:22,800 --> 03:34:23,800
Okay.

3031
03:34:44,800 --> 03:34:45,800
You like it, don't you?

3032
03:34:49,800 --> 03:34:51,800
One, two, three.

3033
03:35:09,800 --> 03:35:10,800
Here you are.

3034
03:35:11,800 --> 03:35:12,800
Take it.

3035
03:35:20,800 --> 03:35:21,800
Here you are.

3036
03:35:31,800 --> 03:35:32,800
You like it, don't you?

3037
03:35:32,800 --> 03:35:33,800
Yes.

3038
03:35:50,800 --> 03:35:51,800
Here you are.

3039
03:36:00,800 --> 03:36:01,800
You like it, don't you?

3040
03:36:01,800 --> 03:36:02,800
Yes.

3041
03:36:19,800 --> 03:36:20,800
Here you are.

3042
03:36:30,800 --> 03:36:31,800
No.

3043
03:36:32,800 --> 03:36:33,800
Take it.

3044
03:36:34,800 --> 03:36:35,800
You can't eat it yet.

3045
03:36:35,800 --> 03:36:36,800
Okay.

3046
03:36:50,800 --> 03:36:51,800
You like it?

3047
03:36:51,800 --> 03:36:52,800
I like it.

3048
03:36:53,800 --> 03:36:54,800
What?

3049
03:36:55,800 --> 03:36:56,800
What's wrong?

3050
03:36:56,800 --> 03:36:57,800
Are you going to eat it?

3051
03:36:57,800 --> 03:36:58,800
Yes.

3052
03:36:58,800 --> 03:36:59,800
Then.

3053
03:37:03,800 --> 03:37:04,800
No.

3054
03:37:04,800 --> 03:37:05,800
I don't want you to eat it yet.

3055
03:37:05,800 --> 03:37:06,800
Next time.

3056
03:37:10,800 --> 03:37:11,800
No.

3057
03:37:11,800 --> 03:37:12,800
I want you to eat it.

3058
03:37:13,800 --> 03:37:14,800
No.

3059
03:37:14,800 --> 03:37:15,800
I want you to eat it.

3060
03:37:15,800 --> 03:37:16,800
No.

3061
03:37:17,800 --> 03:37:18,800
No.

3062
03:37:19,800 --> 03:37:22,280
It'll be fine, don't worry.

3063
03:37:37,060 --> 03:37:40,680
Stretch out to the legs and exhale heavily.

3064
03:37:49,800 --> 03:37:51,800
Oh...

3065
03:37:51,800 --> 03:37:53,800
Oh...

3066
03:37:53,800 --> 03:37:55,800
Oh...

3067
03:37:55,800 --> 03:37:57,800
Oh...

3068
03:37:57,800 --> 03:37:59,800
Oh...

3069
03:37:59,800 --> 03:38:01,800
Oh...

3070
03:38:01,800 --> 03:38:03,800
Oh...

3071
03:38:03,800 --> 03:38:05,800
Oh...

3072
03:38:05,800 --> 03:38:07,800
Oh...

3073
03:38:07,800 --> 03:38:09,800
Oh...

3074
03:38:09,800 --> 03:38:11,800
Oh...

3075
03:38:11,800 --> 03:38:13,800
I want to lick you a lot.

3076
03:38:13,800 --> 03:38:15,800
Oh, no.

3077
03:38:15,800 --> 03:38:17,800
Oh...

3078
03:38:47,800 --> 03:38:52,800
It's so delicious that I can't stop eating it.

3079
03:38:52,800 --> 03:38:57,800
It's so delicious that I can't stop eating it.

3080
03:38:57,800 --> 03:39:02,800
It's so delicious that I can't stop eating it.

3081
03:39:02,800 --> 03:39:07,800
It's so delicious that I can't stop eating it.

3082
03:39:07,800 --> 03:39:12,800
It's so delicious that I can't stop eating it.

3083
03:39:12,800 --> 03:39:17,800
It's so delicious that I can't stop eating it.

3084
03:39:17,800 --> 03:39:22,800
It's so delicious that I can't stop eating it.

3085
03:39:22,800 --> 03:39:27,800
It's so delicious that I can't stop eating it.

3086
03:39:27,800 --> 03:39:32,800
It's so delicious that I can't stop eating it.

3087
03:39:32,800 --> 03:39:37,800
It's so delicious that I can't stop eating it.

3088
03:39:37,800 --> 03:39:42,800
What is this?

3089
03:39:42,800 --> 03:39:47,800
What is this?

3090
03:39:47,800 --> 03:39:52,800
I can not stop it because it seems to come out.

3091
03:39:52,800 --> 03:39:57,800
I can not stop it because it seems to come out.

3092
03:39:57,800 --> 03:40:02,800
I'm coming out.

3093
03:40:02,800 --> 03:40:05,240
If that's the case, I'll come over here.

3094
03:40:05,240 --> 03:40:08,240
If you're going to do it, do it this way.

3095
03:40:08,240 --> 03:40:10,240
Oh, my God.

3096
03:40:32,240 --> 03:40:35,240
It feels so good that I'm sweating.

3097
03:40:38,240 --> 03:40:40,240
It feels so good that I'm sweating.

3098
03:40:47,240 --> 03:40:49,240
It feels so good that I'm sweating.

3099
03:41:08,240 --> 03:41:28,240
It feels so good that I'm sweating.

3100
03:41:38,240 --> 03:41:40,240
It feels so good that I'm sweating.

3101
03:42:08,240 --> 03:42:10,240
It feels so good that I'm sweating.

3102
03:42:39,240 --> 03:42:41,240
It feels so good that I'm sweating.

3103
03:43:00,240 --> 03:43:01,240
What's wrong?

3104
03:43:01,240 --> 03:43:03,240
I can't do it anymore.

3105
03:43:03,240 --> 03:43:05,240
I can't do it anymore.

3106
03:43:05,240 --> 03:43:07,240
I can't do it.

3107
03:43:07,240 --> 03:43:10,240
But let me stand up again soon.

3108
03:43:10,240 --> 03:43:11,240
But let me stand up again soon.

3109
03:43:11,240 --> 03:43:12,240
Is that okay?

3110
03:43:12,240 --> 03:43:13,240
Is that okay?

3111
03:43:13,240 --> 03:43:15,240
Then it's okay.

3112
03:43:15,240 --> 03:43:17,240
Then it's okay.

3113
03:43:38,240 --> 03:43:40,240
I can't do it anymore.

3114
03:43:47,240 --> 03:43:49,240
I'm out of breath.

3115
03:43:56,240 --> 03:43:57,240
I'm out of breath.

3116
03:43:58,240 --> 03:44:00,240
Let's continue.

3117
03:44:08,240 --> 03:44:10,240
I can't do it anymore.

3118
03:44:34,240 --> 03:44:36,240
I can't do it anymore.

3119
03:44:37,240 --> 03:44:39,240
I can't do it anymore.

3120
03:44:43,240 --> 03:44:45,240
It hurts.

3121
03:44:46,240 --> 03:44:48,240
I can't do it anymore.

3122
03:44:53,240 --> 03:44:55,240
I can't do it anymore.

3123
03:44:58,240 --> 03:45:00,240
I can't do it anymore.

3124
03:45:08,240 --> 03:45:10,240
I can't do it anymore.

3125
03:45:10,240 --> 03:45:12,240
Let's continue.

3126
03:45:12,240 --> 03:45:14,240
I can't do it anymore.

3127
03:45:16,240 --> 03:45:18,240
I can't do it anymore.

3128
03:45:19,240 --> 03:45:21,240
It feels so good.

3129
03:45:22,240 --> 03:45:24,240
I can't do it anymore.

3130
03:45:24,240 --> 03:45:26,240
I can't do it anymore.

3131
03:45:26,240 --> 03:45:28,240
I can't do it anymore.

3132
03:45:48,240 --> 03:45:50,240
I can't do it anymore.

3133
03:45:52,240 --> 03:45:54,240
I'm out of breath.

3134
03:45:57,240 --> 03:45:59,240
It feels so good.

3135
03:46:00,240 --> 03:46:02,240
I can't do it anymore.

3136
03:46:06,240 --> 03:46:08,240
I can't do it anymore.

3137
03:46:08,240 --> 03:46:10,240
I can't do it anymore.

3138
03:46:10,240 --> 03:46:12,240
What are you doing?

3139
03:46:12,240 --> 03:46:14,240
You should stop it.

3140
03:46:14,240 --> 03:46:15,240
You should stop it.

3141
03:46:15,240 --> 03:46:17,240
I can't do it anymore.

3142
03:46:17,240 --> 03:46:19,240
I can't do it anymore.

3143
03:46:27,240 --> 03:46:29,240
I can't do it anymore.

3144
03:46:51,240 --> 03:46:53,240
I need to clean your ears.

3145
03:46:56,240 --> 03:46:58,240
I can't do it anymore.

3146
03:47:12,240 --> 03:47:14,240
I'm going to regret for the next three months.

3147
03:47:16,240 --> 03:47:18,240
You should have told me earlier.

3148
03:47:20,240 --> 03:47:22,240
I'm sorry.

3149
03:47:23,240 --> 03:47:25,240
But...

3150
03:47:25,240 --> 03:47:27,240
I'm going to do it every day from now on.

3151
03:47:31,240 --> 03:47:33,240
I didn't think it would feel so good.

3152
03:47:44,240 --> 03:47:46,240
You need to study.

3153
03:47:46,240 --> 03:47:48,240
You're a student now.

3154
03:47:53,240 --> 03:47:55,240
See you later.

3155
03:47:55,240 --> 03:47:57,240
See you later.

3156
03:48:04,240 --> 03:48:06,240
Can I pass the audition?

3157
03:48:10,240 --> 03:48:12,240
What will happen to me from now on?

3158
03:48:15,240 --> 03:48:17,240
Can I study?

3159
03:48:17,240 --> 03:48:19,240
Can I pass the audition?

3160
03:48:19,240 --> 03:48:21,240
Can I pass the audition?

3161
03:48:23,240 --> 03:48:25,240
I don't want to have sex with Naomi.

3162
03:48:29,240 --> 03:48:31,240
What are you doing?

3163
03:48:35,240 --> 03:48:37,240
It's warm.

3164
03:48:37,240 --> 03:48:39,240
Wait a minute.

3165
03:48:39,240 --> 03:48:41,240
I have a bath.

3166
03:48:41,240 --> 03:48:43,240
I have a bath.

3167
03:48:44,240 --> 03:48:46,240
Isn't it too small?

3168
03:48:46,240 --> 03:48:48,240
It's okay.

3169
03:48:48,240 --> 03:48:50,240
It's okay.

3170
03:48:50,240 --> 03:48:52,240
I'm not wet.

3171
03:48:53,240 --> 03:48:55,240
But my father will come back today.

3172
03:48:55,240 --> 03:48:57,240
Don't worry.

3173
03:48:57,240 --> 03:48:59,240
I won't be able to see him.

3174
03:48:59,240 --> 03:49:01,240
Really?

3175
03:49:01,240 --> 03:49:03,240
If I take a bath,

3176
03:49:03,240 --> 03:49:05,240
I'll be able to see him.

3177
03:49:05,240 --> 03:49:07,240
So I should take a bath, right?

3178
03:49:09,240 --> 03:49:11,240
I see.

3179
03:49:11,240 --> 03:49:13,240
Is it okay?

3180
03:49:13,240 --> 03:49:15,240
It's okay.

3181
03:49:37,240 --> 03:49:39,240
You can touch me if you want.

3182
03:49:42,240 --> 03:49:44,240
Okay.

3183
03:49:49,240 --> 03:49:51,240
If you touch me,

3184
03:49:51,240 --> 03:49:53,240
I'll kiss you.

3185
03:49:53,240 --> 03:49:55,240
I'll kiss you.

3186
03:49:55,240 --> 03:49:57,240
I'll kiss you.

3187
03:49:59,240 --> 03:50:01,240
I'm drunk.

3188
03:50:01,240 --> 03:50:03,240
I'll kiss you.

3189
03:50:07,240 --> 03:50:09,240
If you have a girlfriend,

3190
03:50:09,240 --> 03:50:11,240
don't touch me.

3191
03:50:11,240 --> 03:50:13,240
Don't you have a girlfriend?

3192
03:50:13,240 --> 03:50:15,240
Even if you have a girlfriend at home,

3193
03:50:15,240 --> 03:50:17,240
don't touch me.

3194
03:50:17,240 --> 03:50:19,240
Okay.

3195
03:50:19,240 --> 03:50:21,240
I promise.

3196
03:50:21,240 --> 03:50:23,240
I promise.

3197
03:50:25,240 --> 03:50:27,240
You have a big belly.

3198
03:50:29,240 --> 03:50:31,240
You have a big belly.

3199
03:50:35,240 --> 03:50:37,240
Your boobs are big and soft.

3200
03:50:39,240 --> 03:50:41,240
Your boobs are big and soft.

3201
03:50:41,240 --> 03:50:43,240
If you want to touch my boobs,

3202
03:50:45,240 --> 03:50:47,240
you can come to my room.

3203
03:50:47,240 --> 03:50:49,240
Instead,

3204
03:50:49,240 --> 03:50:51,240
if you want to touch my boobs,

3205
03:50:51,240 --> 03:50:53,240
let me touch your boobs.

3206
03:50:53,240 --> 03:50:55,240
Okay.

3207
03:50:57,240 --> 03:50:59,240
I'll kiss you.

3208
03:51:09,240 --> 03:51:11,240
Your boobs are big and soft.

3209
03:51:11,240 --> 03:51:13,240
It's delicious.

3210
03:51:31,240 --> 03:51:33,240
I want to drink your tea.

3211
03:51:35,240 --> 03:51:37,240
Okay.

3212
03:51:39,240 --> 03:51:41,240
I want to drink your tea.

3213
03:52:09,240 --> 03:52:11,240
I want to drink your tea.

3214
03:52:17,240 --> 03:52:19,240
I want to drink your tea.

3215
03:52:39,240 --> 03:52:41,240
I want to drink your tea.

3216
03:52:43,240 --> 03:52:45,240
Can I touch your boobs?

3217
03:52:45,240 --> 03:52:47,240
Can I touch your boobs?

3218
03:52:47,240 --> 03:52:49,240
Okay.

3219
03:53:09,240 --> 03:53:11,240
Okay.

3220
03:53:21,240 --> 03:53:23,240
Can I touch your boobs?

3221
03:53:23,240 --> 03:53:25,240
Okay.

3222
03:53:39,240 --> 03:53:41,240
Okay.

3223
03:53:49,240 --> 03:53:51,240
Can I touch your boobs?

3224
03:53:51,240 --> 03:53:53,240
Okay.

3225
03:53:53,240 --> 03:53:55,240
Can I touch your boobs?

3226
03:53:55,240 --> 03:53:57,240
Okay.

3227
03:53:57,240 --> 03:53:59,240
Can I touch your boobs?

3228
03:53:59,240 --> 03:54:01,240
Okay.

3229
03:54:01,240 --> 03:54:03,240
Can I touch your boobs?

3230
03:54:03,240 --> 03:54:05,240
It's okay, it's okay.

3231
03:54:33,240 --> 03:54:35,240
It's okay, it's okay.

3232
03:54:35,240 --> 03:54:37,240
It's okay, it's okay.

3233
03:54:42,240 --> 03:54:43,240
It's amazing.

3234
03:54:57,240 --> 03:54:58,240
It's amazing.

3235
03:54:59,240 --> 03:55:03,240
It's amazing how you feel over there.

3236
03:55:05,240 --> 03:55:07,240
It's amazing how you feel over there.

3237
03:55:08,240 --> 03:55:09,240
It's amazing.

3238
03:55:36,240 --> 03:55:37,240
It's amazing.

3239
03:55:59,240 --> 03:56:00,240
It's amazing.

3240
03:56:05,240 --> 03:56:07,240
It's amazing how you feel over there.

3241
03:56:23,240 --> 03:56:24,240
Tomoshiku?

3242
03:56:25,240 --> 03:56:26,240
Yes, yes.

3243
03:56:28,240 --> 03:56:29,240
Have you seen Naomi?

3244
03:56:30,240 --> 03:56:31,240
Naomi?

3245
03:56:32,240 --> 03:56:33,240
I don't know her.

3246
03:56:35,240 --> 03:56:36,240
Is she in the toilet?

3247
03:56:37,240 --> 03:56:38,240
I don't think she's in the toilet.

3248
03:56:38,240 --> 03:56:40,240
I wonder if she went out.

3249
03:56:42,240 --> 03:56:48,240
She said she was going to cook for us, so I'm sure she's in there.

3250
03:56:49,240 --> 03:56:50,240
Is that so?

3251
03:56:51,240 --> 03:56:53,240
That's why I bought a new one.

3252
03:56:58,240 --> 03:57:01,240
Tomoku, let's go eat something.

3253
03:57:06,240 --> 03:57:07,240
What?

3254
03:57:08,240 --> 03:57:09,240
Are you going?

3255
03:57:09,240 --> 03:57:10,240
No, I'm not going.

3256
03:57:10,240 --> 03:57:11,240
No, I'm going.

3257
03:57:12,240 --> 03:57:13,240
Are you going or not?

3258
03:57:14,240 --> 03:57:15,240
I'm going, but I'm not going.

3259
03:57:17,240 --> 03:57:18,240
Let's go.

3260
03:57:19,240 --> 03:57:20,240
No, I'm not going.

3261
03:57:20,240 --> 03:57:21,240
I can't go now.

3262
03:57:22,240 --> 03:57:23,240
I see.

3263
03:57:24,240 --> 03:57:25,240
Let's order.

3264
03:57:26,240 --> 03:57:27,240
Yes, let's order.

3265
03:57:28,240 --> 03:57:29,240
You're not going, are you?

3266
03:57:29,240 --> 03:57:30,240
I'm not going.

3267
03:57:31,240 --> 03:57:32,240
I'll leave it to you.

3268
03:57:33,240 --> 03:57:34,240
I'm sorry.

3269
03:57:35,240 --> 03:57:36,240
I'll leave it to you.

3270
03:57:36,240 --> 03:57:37,240
Yes, please.

3271
03:57:42,240 --> 03:57:45,240
Naomi, my dad will find out.

3272
03:57:46,240 --> 03:57:47,240
He'll find out.

3273
03:57:47,240 --> 03:57:49,240
It's okay. He didn't find out.

3274
03:57:49,240 --> 03:57:50,240
But I'm really sorry.

3275
03:57:51,240 --> 03:57:52,240
I'm sorry.

3276
03:57:53,240 --> 03:57:55,240
I didn't mean to be so harsh.

3277
03:57:58,240 --> 03:57:59,240
Let's continue.

3278
03:57:59,240 --> 03:58:00,240
Are you okay?

3279
03:58:00,240 --> 03:58:01,240
Hurry up.

3280
03:58:02,240 --> 03:58:05,240
You can't go to the bathroom.

3281
03:58:06,240 --> 03:58:08,240
You can go to the bathroom as many times as you want.

3282
03:58:10,240 --> 03:58:11,240
I'm sorry.

3283
03:58:17,240 --> 03:58:18,240
It feels good.

3284
03:58:20,240 --> 03:58:21,240
You can't go to the bathroom.

3285
03:58:21,240 --> 03:58:22,240
You can't go to the bathroom.

3286
03:58:26,240 --> 03:58:27,240
It's disgusting.

3287
03:58:32,240 --> 03:58:33,240
I'm sorry.

3288
03:58:40,240 --> 03:58:41,240
I'm sorry.

3289
03:59:01,240 --> 03:59:02,240
I'm sorry.

3290
03:59:03,240 --> 03:59:04,240
I'm sorry.

3291
03:59:05,240 --> 03:59:06,240
I'm sorry.

3292
03:59:06,240 --> 03:59:07,240
I'm sorry.

3293
03:59:07,240 --> 03:59:08,240
I'm sorry.

3294
03:59:08,240 --> 03:59:09,240
I'm sorry.

3295
03:59:09,240 --> 03:59:10,240

03:59:18,240 --> 03:59:19,240
I'm sorry.

3305
03:59:19,240 --> 03:59:20,240
I'm sorry.

3306
03:59:20,240 --> 03:59:21,240
I'm sorry.

3307
03:59:21,240 --> 03:59:22,240
I'm sorry.

3308
03:59:22,240 --> 03:59:23,240
I'm sorry.

3309
03:59:23,240 --> 03:59:24,240
I'm sorry.

3310
03:59:25,240 --> 03:59:26,240
I'm sorry.

3311
03:59:26,240 --> 03:59:27,240
I'm sorry.

3312
03:59:27,240 --> 03:59:28,240
I'm sorry.

3313
03:59:28,240 --> 03:59:29,240
I'm sorry.

3314
03:59:29,240 --> 03:59:30,240
I'm sorry.

3315
03:59:30,240 --> 03:59:31,240
I'm sorry.

3316
03:59:32,240 --> 03:59:33,240
I'm sorry.

3317
03:59:35,240 --> 03:59:37,240
It's disgusting.

3318
03:59:39,240 --> 03:59:41,240
I'm sorry.

3319
03:59:56,240 --> 03:59:58,240
It hurts.

3320
03:59:58,240 --> 03:59:59,620
Are you okay?

3321
04:00:02,080 --> 04:00:03,580
Come on.

3322
04:00:09,200 --> 04:00:10,400
Tickles.

3323
04:00:22,580 --> 04:00:23,560
Come on.

3324
04:00:28,240 --> 04:00:35,240
What is pulling me?

3325
04:00:35,240 --> 04:00:42,240
What are you running this time!

3326
04:00:42,240 --> 04:00:43,240
Mom-

3327
04:00:43,240 --> 04:00:48,240
That's a lobster!

3328
04:00:48,240 --> 04:00:53,240
Mom-

3329
04:00:53,240 --> 04:00:56,240
Keep calm.

3330
04:00:56,240 --> 04:00:58,240
my baby!

3331
04:01:21,460 --> 04:01:23,460
Don't cry!

3332
04:01:26,240 --> 04:01:28,240
It's so good.

3333
04:01:36,240 --> 04:01:38,240
It feels so good.

3334
04:01:42,240 --> 04:01:48,240
Let's go to the kitchen and other places around the house.

3335
04:01:48,240 --> 04:01:50,240
Yes.

3336
04:01:50,240 --> 04:01:52,240
I have to go back soon.

3337
04:01:52,240 --> 04:01:54,240
My father will be suspicious.

3338
04:01:54,240 --> 04:01:56,240
I understand.

3339
04:01:56,240 --> 04:01:58,240
I'll cook the rice.

3340
04:01:58,240 --> 04:02:00,240
Okay.

3341
04:02:04,240 --> 04:02:06,240
He is definitely a prisoner.

3342
04:02:07,240 --> 04:02:09,240
I don't care.

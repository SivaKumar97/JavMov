1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,420
When you develop your skills, your connection with people changes.

2
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,460
You came in a little late yesterday though.

3
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,460
Yeah.

4
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,460
Did you have a proper dinner?

5
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,460
Yeah.

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,460
I had dinner with the employees.

7
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,460
It was either beef bowl or pizza.

8
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,460
Well, it can't be helped if you work overtime.

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,460
I wish you could take a little more time.

10
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,460
Yeah.

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,460
Yeah.

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,460
I'm busy now.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,460
I can't take care of my diet.

14
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,460
I see.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,460
I wish you could take a little more time.

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,460
Do you want to go somewhere?

17
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,460
Yeah.

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,460
Hot spring.

19
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,460
Let's go when you calm down.

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,460
Yeah.

21
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,460
Please let me sleep here.

22
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,460
I'm sorry, Egawa-kun.

23
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,460
It's okay.

24
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,460
You drink too much.

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,460
Well, it can't be helped because I'm a company employee.

26
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,460
What? You're a company employee?

27
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,460
Don't you know that?

28
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,460
What do you mean?

29
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,460
Our company is in trouble now.

30
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,460
Our software is full of bugs.

31
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,460
We were refused to sign a contract.

32
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,460
And we spent a lot of money on the development team.

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,460
What do you mean?

34
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,460
Is that true?

35
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,460
If it goes on like this, our company will go bankrupt.

36
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,460
Was our company in such a situation?

37
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,460
We were refused to sign a contract with a bank.

38
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,460
And we have to rely on Mr. Yamane.

39
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,460
Who is Mr. Yamane?

40
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,460
He's an individual investor and the owner of our company.

41
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,460
But the president seems to hate Mr. Yamane very much.

42
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,460
It's not the time to say whether I like him or not.

43
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,460
The president is very proud.

44
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,460
So, he won't go to Mr. Yamane.

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,460
Oh, right.

46
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,460
If it's okay with you,

47
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,460
your wife can ask Mr. Yamane.

48
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,460
Me?

49
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,460
Yes.

50
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,460
Welcome.

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,460
Come in.

52
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,460
Yes.

53
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,460
So,

54
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,460
what does the wife of Mr. Yamane want from me?

55
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,460
Well,

56
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,460
I'm here to ask you for a favor.

57
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,460
Oh,

58
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,460
do you have an order?

59
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,460
Yes.

60
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,460
Oh, I see.

61
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,460
Have a seat.

62
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,460
Thank you.

63
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,460
Did you tell the president of Mishima that you would come here?

64
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,460
No.

65
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,460
I see.

66
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,460
Then, show me your attitude.

67
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,460
My attitude?

68
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
Yes.

69
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
Hurry up.

70
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,460
I see.

71
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,460
You're here to ask me for a favor, aren't you?

72
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,460
Yes.

73
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,460
I'll do my best.

74
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,460
Your wife...

75
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
Shh!

76
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,460
I see.

77
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,460
You should kneel down.

78
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,460
No, I don't want to.

79
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,460
You're here to ask me for a favor, aren't you?

80
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,460
Yes.

81
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,460
I'll do my best.

82
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,460
Well,

83
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,460
you don't have to think about it.

84
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,460
It's up to you.

85
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,460
Oh, no.

86
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,460
Please don't.

87
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,460
You don't have to be prepared.

88
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,460
I'm prepared.

89
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,460
Then, show me.

90
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,460
I can't understand.

91
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,460
I'll do my best.

92
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,460
You can't do anything with words.

93
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,460
Even if you say so,

94
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,460
here you are.

95
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,460
I said it's up to you.

96
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,460
If you do your best,

97
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,460
Mr. Mihama will help you.

98
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,460
Yes.

99
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,460
That's all.

100
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,460
No, it's not.

101
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,460
I feel sorry for your wife.

102
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,460
I'll do my best.

103
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,460
No, you can't.

104
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,460
I'll pay you back someday.

105
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,460
Someday?

106
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,460
You have to pay me first.

107
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,460
Now?

108
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,460
Yes, now.

109
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,460
Well...

110
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,460
Just say it.

111
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,460
What?

112
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,460
Mr. Mihama

114
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,460
Hello.

115
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,460
Miki, where is the president?

116
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,460
What?

117
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,460
Is he all right?

118
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,460
I don't know.

119
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,460
Do you want something to drink?

120
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,460
No, thank you.

121
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,460
President.

122
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,460
Honey.

123
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,460
When I tried to go to the deal,

124
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,460
he collapsed suddenly.

125
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,460
What?

126
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,460
Don't exaggerate.

127
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,460
I told you to take care of your health.

128
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
I'm fine.

129
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,460
I'll take a rest today.

130
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,460
Mr. Mihama collapsed.

131
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,460
What?

132
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,460
Did your wife eat something strange?

133
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,460
No, she didn't.

134
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,460
You know what to do, don't you?

135
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,460
I'll do my best.

136
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,460
Please go home.

137
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,460
Thank you.

138
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,460
Do it from the beginning.

139
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,460
Take off your clothes.

140
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,460
What?

141
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,460
Are you going to be late again?

142
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,460
No, I'm not.

143
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,460
You're here to tell your wife, aren't you?

144
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,460
Yes, I understand.

145
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,460
Take off your clothes.

146
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,460
What are you doing?

147
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,460
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,460
You're flustered, aren't you?

149
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,460
You're nervous because you want to see him again, aren't you?

150
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,460
No, I'm not.

151
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,460
Your wife is big.

152
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,460
What are you embarrassed about?

153
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,460
Hurry up.

154
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,460
Okay.

155
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,460
You're wearing a cute shirt.

156
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,460
You're wearing a cute shirt.

157
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,460
You're wearing a cute shirt.

158
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,460
What are you doing?

159
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,460
Don't take it off.

160
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,460
You're here to get your money back, aren't you?

161
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,460
That's right.

162
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,460
Please don't.

163
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,460
That's enough.

164
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,460
Go home.

165
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,460
Please go home.

166
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,460
I took it off.

167
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,460
I need money.

168
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,460
You have no choice but to listen to me.

169
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,460
I understand.

170
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,460
Put your hands behind your back.

171
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,460
Put your hands behind your back.

172
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,460
Put your hands behind your back.

173
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,460
Look at me.

174
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,460
Look at me.

175
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,460
Hurry up.

176
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,460
Like this?

177
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,460
Of course.

178
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,460
Come closer.

179
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,460
Hurry up.

180
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,460
Look at me.

181
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,460
Look at me.

182
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,460
Like this?

183
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,460
You're wearing a nice shirt.

184
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,460
Sit down.

185
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,460
What are you doing?

186
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,460
Hurry up.

187
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,460
Spread your legs.

188
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,460
Okay.

189
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,460
Why are you embarrassed?

190
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,460
Look at me.

191
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,460
Look at me.

192
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,460
You're still hiding.

193
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,460
I have to tell you twice.

194
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,460
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,460
Look at me.

196
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,460
Look at me.

197
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,460
Your hands are in the way.

198
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,460
You're wearing a nice shirt.

199
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,460
Spread your legs.

200
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,460
Look at me.

201
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,460
I want to take a picture of your face.

202
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,460
Okay.

203
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,460
Look at me and make an excuse.

204
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,460
Make me feel bad.

205
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,460
That's how you become brave.

206
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,460
Okay.

207
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,460
Touch me.

208
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
Look at me.

209
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,460
You have to make me feel bad.

210
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,460
I can't get excited.

211
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,460
Okay.

212
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,460
You have to make me laugh.

213
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,460
Look at me.

214
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,460
You don't have to do that.

215
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,460
Your legs are closing.

216
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,460
Think about yourself.

217
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,460
Okay.

218
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,460
Do you always do that alone?

219
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,460
No.

220
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,460
You want to feel better, don't you?

221
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,460
Keep doing it.

222
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,460
Okay.

223
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,460
I can't tell if you look at me or not.

224
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,460
Okay.

225
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,460
You're boring.

226
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,460
Be brave.

227
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,460
Okay.

228
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,460
That's how you become brave.

229
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,460
Are you underestimating me?

230
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,460
No, I'm not.

231
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,460
You can't even say it.

232
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,460
I'm doing it.

233
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,460
You're pretending to do it.

234
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,460
You're pretending to do it.

235
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,460
You're an adult.

236
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,460
Show me.

237
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,460
Don't be a pervert.

238
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,460
Okay.

239
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,460
Show me.

240
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,460
Okay.

241
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,460
You're getting better.

242
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,460
Your legs are closing.

243
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,460
You're trying to get excited.

244
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,460
No, I'm not.

245
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,460
No, you're not.

246
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,460
Your voice is getting better.

247
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,460
Do you want me to help you?

248
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,460
What?

249
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,460
Keep doing it.

250
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,460
Okay.

251
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,460
Don't expect too much.

252
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,460
Look at me.

253
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,460
Okay.

254
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
Do you feel better?

255
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,460
No, I don't.

256
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,460
Don't lie to me.

257
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,460
Okay.

258
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,460
It's better to lie to someone.

259
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,460
That's right.

260
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,460
Do you feel better?

261
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
Yes, I do.

262
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,460
You're brave.

263
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,460
Okay.

264
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,460
Show me more.

265
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,460
It's close.

266
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,460
Hurry up.

267
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,460
Okay.

268
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,460
Look at me.

269
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,460
Look at me.

270
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,460
I'm helping you.

271
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,460
Thank you.

272
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,460
You don't feel anything.

273
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,460
You're boring.

274
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,460
Is that all?

275
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,460
No, it's not.

276
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,460
I see.

277
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,460
Show me your action.

278
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,460
Hurry up.

279
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,460
You know what I mean, right?

280
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,460
Yes, I do.

281
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,460
Why did you touch me?

282
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,460
What?

283
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,460
I told you.

284
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,460
I didn't say anything.

285
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,460
I just said I know.

286
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,460
Did you want to touch me?

287
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,460
No.

288
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,460
Say you want to touch me.

289
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,460
Hurry up.

290
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,460
I want to touch you.

291
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,460
Please.

292
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,460
You're clumsy.

293
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,460
Hurry up.

294
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,460
Please.

295
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,460
I want to touch you.

296
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,460
Please.

297
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,460
You're clumsy.

298
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,460
Hurry up.

299
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,460
I want to touch you.

300
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,460
I want to touch you.

301
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,460
Please.

302
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,460
Hurry up.

303
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,460
Okay.

304
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,460
Rub it well.

305
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,460
Okay.

306
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,460
I can't feel your hand.

307
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,460
Okay.

308
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
I can't do it.

309
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,460
It's not enough.

310
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
What?

311
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,460
I did my best.

312
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,460
It's not enough.

313
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,460
I'll do my best.

314
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,460
Okay.

315
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,460
Please.

316
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,460
Okay.

317
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,460
I can't feel your hand.

318
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,460
Do you want to touch me?

319
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,460
Yes.

320
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,460
If you say so,

321
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,460
I can't feel your hand.

322
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,460
I'll do my best.

323
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,460
Please.

324
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,460
Rub it well.

325
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
Okay.

326
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,460
Don't be shy.

327
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,460
Hurry up.

328
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Okay.

329
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,460
It's been a long time.

330
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,460
Thank you.

331
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,460
You're so desperate.

332
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,460
Yes, I am.

333
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:14,460
I can't feel your hand.

334
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,460
What should I do?

335
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,460
Well...

336
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,460
Do you want me to show you how to do it?

337
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
Do you want me to show you how to do it?

338
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,460
Do you want me to show you how to do it?

339
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,460
Try it.

340
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
Okay.

341
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,460
Hurry up.

342
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,460
You're weak.

343
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,460
I'll give you a snack.

344
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,460
Okay.

345
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,460
It's good, isn't it?

346
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,460
Yes.

347
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,460
You're so weak.

348
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,460
I'll give you a snack.

349
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,460
Okay.

350
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,460
You're so weak.

351
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,460
I'll give you a snack.

352
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,460
Okay.

353
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,460
You're so weak.

354
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,460
I'll give you a snack.

355
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,460
Okay.

356
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,460
Do you want me to do it?

357
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,460
Do it yourself.

358
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,460
Do you want me to do it?

359
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,460
I didn't ask you to stop.

360
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,460
I'll give you a snack if you get angry.

361
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,460
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,460
I'm sorry.

363
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,460
I told you to stand up.

364
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,460
I told you to stand up.

365
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,460
You're in a bad condition.

366
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,460
You're in a bad condition.

367
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
Hurry up.

368
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,460
Say, please.

369
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Please.

370
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,460
What should I do?

371
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,460
If you say so,

372
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,460
I have no choice but to think about it.

373
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,460
Do you lick your face?

374
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,460
No, I don't.

375
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,460
You have a lot of hair on your hands.

376
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,460
You have to use it.

377
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,460
Yes.

378
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:09,460
I want you to lick my hand.

379
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,460
Do you know that?

380
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,460
Yes.

381
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,460
You have to rest your hands and wash your mouth.

382
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,460
Where are you going?

383
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Where are you going?

384
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,460
Look at me.

385
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,460
Look at me.

386
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
Look at me.

387
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
Look at me.

388
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,460
Look at me.

389
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Look at me.

390
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,460
You are trembling.

391
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,460
You are trembling.

392
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,460
Let's do it now.

393
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,460
Come here.

394
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,460
Show me there.

395
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,460
Again?

396
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,460
Again.

397
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
Come on.

398
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,460
Like this?

399
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,460
Yes, hurry up.

400
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,460
Okay.

401
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,460
Do it like this.

402
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,460
Okay.

403
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,460
Okay.

404
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,460
Touch me.

405
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,460
Show me your private part.

406
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,460
Trust is important.

407
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
You have to be careful.

408
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,460
Okay.

409
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,460
It's a little close.

410
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,460
Keep doing it.

411
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,460
Okay.

412
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,460
Let's do it again.

413
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,460
Keep doing it.

414
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,460
Keep doing it.

415
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,460
Touch me.

416
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,460
Touch your private part.

417
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,460
Okay.

418
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,460
Touch your private part.

419
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,460
Look at me.

420
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,460
Okay.

421
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,460
It's a little big.

422
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,460
You like big things, don't you?

423
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,460
You like big things, don't you?

424
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,460
My stomach hurts.

425
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,460
My stomach hurts.

426
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,460
You are trembling.

427
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,460
You are trembling.

428
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,460
Your hands are not stopped.

429
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,460
Your hands are not stopped.

430
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,460
My stomach hurts.

431
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,460
Let's do it again.

432
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,460
Let's do it again.

433
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,460
Okay.

434
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
Let's do it again.

435
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,460
Let's do it again.

436
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,460
Let's do it again.

437
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,460
What?

438
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,460
I'm helping you.

439
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,460
Are you happy?

440
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
Thank you very much.

441
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
Are you happy?

442
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,460
Are you happy?

443
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,460
It's getting a little cold, isn't it?

444
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,460
It's getting a little cold, isn't it?

445
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,460
Touch your private part.

446
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,460
Touch your private part.

447
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
I think one is not enough.

448
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,460
I think one is not enough.

449
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,460
What?

450
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,460
Hold your feet.

451
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,460
Hold your feet.

452
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,460
This part, too.

453
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,460
This part, too.

454
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,460
Hold your feet firmly.

455
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,460
Hold your feet firmly.

456
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,460
It's very tight.

457
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
It's not like that.

458
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,460
It's not like that.

459
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,100
Don't lick such a dirty thing.

460
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,100
It can't be helped.

461
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:41,460
It feels good to be licked by yourself, doesn't it?

462
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,460
Yes, it feels good.

463
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:49,460
You are very honest.

464
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:55,460
If you are so honest, as a man, you should be quiet.

465
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:03,460
Do you want me to make you feel good?

466
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Say something.

467
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,460
Yes, please.

468
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,460
Do you want me to make you feel good?

469
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,460
Yes.

470
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,460
Then, roll over.

471
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,460
Here?

472
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,460
Yes.

473
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,460
Yes.

474
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,460
Yes, yes, yes.

475
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:35,460
Wait a minute.

476
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,460
Please.

477
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,460
Please let me in.

478
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,460
Let me in.

479
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,460
I can't do anything but licking you.

480
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,460
I can't do anything but licking you.

481
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,460
Is that so?

482
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,460
Let's go to bed.

483
00:29:50,460 --> 00:30:00,460
It feels good, doesn't it?

484
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:10,460
It feels good, doesn't it?

485
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:18,460
Your mouth is lonely.

486
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:23,460
What are you going to do?

487
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:34,460
What are you doing?

488
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:48,460
What are you going to do?

489
00:30:48,460 --> 00:31:13,460
What are you doing?

490
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:30,460
Good night.

491
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:51,460
Don't move because it's easy for me to move.

492
00:31:51,460 --> 00:32:20,460
Good night.

493
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,460
Don't move.

494
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:34,460
Don't move.

495
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:54,460
Don't move.

496
00:32:54,460 --> 00:33:08,460
You move too much.

497
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,460
That's why you like me.

498
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,460
You surprised me.

499
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,460
You didn't do anything with me.

500
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,460
I don't do anything private.

501
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:33,460
You don't do anything private.

502
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,460
You've been saying that for a while.

503
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,460
I didn't say that.

504
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,460
You didn't say that for a while.

505
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,460
Don't lie.

506
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,460
Don't lie.

507
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,460
Don't lie.

508
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
Okay.

509
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,460
Don't lie.

510
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,460
Okay.

511
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
Don't lie.

512
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:34,460
Don't lie.

513
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,460
I'm sorry.

514
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,460
It's okay.

515
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,460
I'm sorry.

516
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:20,460
I'm sorry.

517
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:42,460
It's okay.

518
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,460
It's okay.

519
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,460
I'm sorry.

520
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,460
It's okay.

521
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:21,460
It's okay.

522
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,460
I'll be nice to you.

523
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:37,460
Please.

524
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,460
You're getting older.

525
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:48,460
I'm sorry.

526
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,460
Do you do this to Miyama?

527
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,460
No.

528
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,460
What do you do to Miyama?

529
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,460
I don't do it recently.

530
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,460
You don't do it recently.

531
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:04,460
You're lucky.

532
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,460
Did you come here for this?

533
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:42,460
I'll do it myself.

534
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,460
I'll do it myself.

535
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,060
Oh, I see.

536
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,960
Come on.

537
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,420
Move your wrist too.

538
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,060
Let me see your face.

539
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,060
It hurts.

540
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,060
Let me see.

541
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,060
Show me how serious you are.

542
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,060
I don't want to.

543
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,060
Do it.

544
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,060
It feels good.

545
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,060
I'll speed up.

546
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,060
Look at me.

547
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,060
Don't make a noise.

548
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,060
Okay.

549
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,060
It hurts.

550
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
It hurts.

551
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,060
I have underwear.

552
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
Give me your underwear.

553
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,060
You can do it if you want.

554
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,060
It hurts.

555
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,060
It hurts.

556
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,060
Don't make a noise.

557
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,060
It hurts.

558
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,060
Don't make a noise.

559
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,060
It hurts.

560
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,060
You can do it if you want.

561
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,060
It feels good.

562
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,060
Don't make a noise.

563
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,060
You can do it if you want.

564
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,060
It hurts.

565
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,060
It hurts.

566
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,060
I'll speed up.

567
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,060
It hurts.

568
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,060
I can't stop.

569
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,060
I can't stop.

570
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,060
It hurts.

571
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,060
Let me go.

572
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,060
It hurts.

573
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,060
You're so funny.

574
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,060
You're so funny.

575
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,060
You're so funny.

576
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,060
You're so funny.

577
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,060
Wait a minute.

578
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,060
Please go home.

579
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,060
Is this a bath?

580
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,060
It's small.

581
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,060
Don't open the door.

582
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,060
It's okay.

583
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,060
I'll speed up.

584
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,060
What are you doing?

585
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,060
I'm frying.

586
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,060
You can wear shoes.

587
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,060
I can't.

588
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,060
I can't.

589
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,060
It's okay.

590
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,060
Where is it?

591
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,060
Don't go into the bedroom.

592
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,060
Are you sleeping with Mihama here?

593
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,060
Which one are you using?

594
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,060
It smells.

595
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,060
Don't do that.

596
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,060
Why are you in the bed?

597
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,060
Don't do that.

598
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,060
You like sex, don't you?

599
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,060
No.

600
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,060
Why are you inviting me?

601
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,060
I'm not inviting you.

602
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,060
Don't get me wrong.

603
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,060
What do you want me to do?

604
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,060
It's not like that.

605
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,060
Do you want me to shut up?

606
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,060
I've been waiting for you.

607
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,060
It's a little close.

608
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,060
I don't know if it's close.

609
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,060
You're getting excited.

610
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,060
You're opening your mouth.

611
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,060
I'm sorry.

612
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,060
You look like a woman.

613
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,060
I'm scared.

614
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,060
Why?

615
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,060
Do you want me to be cute?

616
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,060
I don't know.

617
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,060
Do you want me to be cute?

618
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,060
I want you to be cute.

619
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,060
Do you want me to be cute?

620
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,060
I don't know.

621
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,060
If you want me to be cute,

622
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,060
Don't you want me to touch you?

623
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,060
Don't you want me to touch you?

624
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,060
Don't you want me to touch you?

625
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,060
Don't you want me to touch you?

626
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,060
Please touch me.

627
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,060
Where?

628
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,060
I want you to touch me on my skin.

629
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,060
I want you to touch me on my skin.

630
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,060
On your skin?

631
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,060
Here?

632
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,060
Yes.

633
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,060
Good.

634
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,060
You're getting excited.

635
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,060
What's this?

636
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,060
I'm embarrassed.

637
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,060
Are you embarrassed?

638
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,060
It's too late.

639
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,060
I'll take it off myself.

640
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,060
I'll take it off myself.

641
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,060
Put it on me.

642
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,060
Yes.

643
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,060
I'll put it on you.

644
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,060
What do you want me to do?

645
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,060
What do you want me to do?

646
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:52,060
Please lick my neck.

647
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:54,060
Please lick my neck.

648
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,060
Please lick my neck.

649
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,060
Why are you so cute?

650
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,060
Why are you so cute?

651
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,060
Are you the only one who feels good?

652
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,060
Are you the only one who feels good?

653
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,060
I feel good.

654
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,060
I feel good.

655
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,060
You like sex so much.

656
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,060
You like sex so much.

657
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,060
I'll put it on you.

658
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,060
You know what I mean, right?

659
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,060
You know what I mean, right?

660
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,060
You know what I mean, right?

661
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,060
Hurry up.

662
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,060
Hurry up.

663
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,060
Move forward.

664
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,060
Move forward.

665
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,060
Look at me.

666
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,060
You can't be so slow.

667
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,060
You can't be so slow.

668
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,060
You don't understand unless I do this.

669
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,060
You don't understand unless I do this.

670
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,060
You don't understand unless I do this.

671
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,060
Open your mouth.

672
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,060
Open your mouth.

673
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,060
Open your mouth.

674
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,060
Open your mouth.

675
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,060
Open your eyes.

676
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,060
Take off your top.

677
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,060
Take off your top.

678
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,060
You have beautiful teeth.

679
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,060
You have beautiful teeth.

680
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,060
It's a waste if you don't use them.

681
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,060
It's a waste if you don't use them.

682
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,060
Yes.

683
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,060
You know what I mean, right?

684
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,060
You can't do it well.

685
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,060
You can't do it well.

686
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,060
You are so excited.

687
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,060
You are so excited.

688
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,060
You told me to do it.

689
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,060
You told me to do it.

690
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,060
What are you biting?

691
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,060
What are you biting?

692
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,060
You are trembling.

693
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,060
You are trembling.

694
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,060
You are trembling.

695
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,060
You are trembling.

696
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,060
You are trembling.

697
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,060
You are trembling.

698
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,060
That's right.

699
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,060
Are you doing it for Mihama-kun?

700
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,060
Then just me?

701
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,060
What? Do you like me?

702
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,060
I do.

703
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,060
What?

704
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,060
It's for Hiroshi.

705
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,060
I wonder if you'll say that at a time like this.

706
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,060
To be honest with your body.

707
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:56,060
You're always sandwiched.

708
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,060
It's on your nipples.

709
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,060
Huh?

710
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,060
Feels good.

711
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,060
It's soft, isn't it?

712
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,060
That's the way to do it.

713
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,060
Licking.

714
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,060
Do you want me to take care of you that much?

715
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,060
Okay, okay.

716
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,060
Why are you resisting?

717
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,060
That's not the way to do it.

718
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,060
It's soft, isn't it?

719
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,060
Okay, okay.

720
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,060
It's hard, isn't it?

721
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,060
It's soft, isn't it?

722
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,060
It's soft, isn't it?

723
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,060
That's the way to do it.

724
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,060
That's the way to do it.

725
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,060
It's soft, isn't it?

726
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,060
You're resisting.

727
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,060
That's the way to do it.

728
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,060
You're happy, aren't you?

729
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,060
You're happy, aren't you?

730
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,060
The other side.

731
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,060
Hold on tight.

732
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,060
It's soft, isn't it?

733
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,060
It's soft, isn't it?

734
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,060
It's wet, isn't it?

735
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,060
It's wet, isn't it?

736
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,060
Look at me.

737
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,060
Touch me.

738
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,060
It's soft, isn't it?

739
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,060
Touch my nipple.

740
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:33,060
It's soft, isn't it?

741
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,060
I'll put my finger in it.

742
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,060
I'll put my finger in it.

743
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,060
It's not enough.

744
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,060
What are you feeling?

745
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,060
What are you feeling?

746
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,060
It's hard, isn't it?

747
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,060
It's hard, isn't it?

748
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,060
It's hot.

749
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,060
What?

750
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,060
It's hot.

751
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,060
It's hot.

752
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,060
It's hard, isn't it?

753
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,060
It's hard, isn't it?

754
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,060
It's hard, isn't it?

755
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,060
It's hard, isn't it?

756
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,060
It's hard, isn't it?

757
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:15,060
It's hard, isn't it?

758
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,060
Turn around.

759
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:37,060
Turn around.

760
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,060
Turn around.

761
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:47,060
What do you want me to do?

762
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,060
From behind.

763
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,060
What?

764
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,060
Please step forward.

765
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,060
You can't be in that position.

766
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,060
You can't be in that position.

767
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:03,060
You can't be in that position.

768
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,060
You can't be in that position.

769
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,060
From behind.

770
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,060
Please.

771
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,060
Please.

772
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,060
You don't have to be in that position.

773
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,060
You don't have to be in that position.

774
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,060
Get down.

775
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,060
Get down.

776
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,060
Get down.

777
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,060
It feels good.

778
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:17,060
It feels good.

779
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,060
It feels good.

780
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,060
It feels good.

781
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,060
Do you like me?

782
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,060
Do you like me?

783
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:45,060
You're very honest.

784
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,060
I have to be honest.

785
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,060
I have to be honest.

786
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,060
I have to be honest.

787
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:31,060
You can do whatever you want.

788
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,060
You can do whatever you want.

789
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,060
It feels good.

790
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,060
It feels good.

791
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:17,060
It feels good.

792
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,060
I'll help you.

793

I'll help you.

795
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:01,060
I'll help you.

796
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,060
Don't get up.

797
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:11,060
Don't get up.

798
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,060
Don't get up.

799
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:48,060
I'm tired.

800
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,060
It's your turn.

801
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,060
It's your turn.

802
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,060
Move.

803
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:19,060
Don't move your boobs too much.

804
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:35,060
Does it hurt?

805
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:48,060
Don't move your boobs too much.

806
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,060

Don't move your boobs too much.

809
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:37,060
Are you happy now?

810
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:39,060
No, I'm not.

811
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,060
You're happy, aren't you?

812
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:43,060
You're happy, aren't you?

813
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,060
Don't move your boobs too much.

814

Don't move your boobs too much.

815
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,060
You're already awake, aren't you?

816
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:09,060
You look like you're in a bad mood.

817
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,060
Look at me.

818
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,060
Don't look away.

819
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,060
Don't move your boobs too much.

820
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,060
Don't hit me.

821
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:40,060
Don't hit me.

822
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,060
Don't hit me.

823
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:09,060

01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:37,060
Look at me.

833
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:39,060
Don't look away.

834
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:41,060
Don't move your boobs too much.

835
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,060
Don't move your boobs too much.

836
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:45,060
Look at me.

837
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,060
It feels good, doesn't it?

838
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:01,060
You're almost there.

839
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,060
You're almost there.

840
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:11,060
You're almost there.

841
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,060
You're almost there.

842
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:04,060
It's not over yet.

843
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:06,060
It's not over yet.

844
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:10,060
It's not over yet.

845
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,060
It's not over yet.

846
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,060
Lean on me.

847
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:36,060
Lean on me.

848
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,060
Lean on me.

849
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,060
It's time to eat.

850
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,060
Incredible.

851
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:28,060
It looks delicious.

852
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:30,060
You're a great cook, Megwin.

853
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,060
You're a great cook, Megwin.

854
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:34,060
Can I have it?

855
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:36,060
Thank you.

856
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,060
That's great.

857
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,060
Thank you.

858
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:40,060
Do you prepare a dinner?

859
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:42,060
I don't think so.

860
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:44,060
That's great.

861
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,060
Mr. Yamane.

862
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,060
Good morning.

863
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:49,060
Good morning.

864
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,060
What's wrong, Mr. Yamane?

865
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,060
Mr. Nihama.

866
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:57,060
It seems that the company is strict.

867
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,060
Let's talk in the back.

868
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:02,060
I'm sorry.

869
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:06,060
I couldn't leave him alone as an investor.

870
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,060
Yes.

871
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:28,060
Let the employees talk within 10 minutes.

872
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:29,060
What?

873
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:34,060
Let the employees talk within 10 minutes.

874
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,060
I can't.

875
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:38,060
You can, Baishun.

876
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:51,060
Are you okay?

877
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,060
Are you from the company?

878
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,060
Yes.

879
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:56,060
I've been working here since spring.

880
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,060
Who are you?

881
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:01,060
I'm Nihama's wife.

882
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:03,060
Are you the president?

883
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:04,060
Nice to meet you.

884
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:05,060
I'm Tuno.

885
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:07,060
Nice to meet you.

886
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:10,060
Don't tell anyone.

887
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:12,060
Come with me.

888
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,060
Wait a minute.

889
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:15,060
Where are you going?

890
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:23,060
What's wrong?

891
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,060
I'm fine.

892
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:27,060
What's wrong?

893
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,060
I'll do it for you.

894
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,060
No.

895
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,060
I can't do it.

896
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,060
It's okay.

897
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,060
I can't do it.

898
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:43,060
Don't tell anyone.

899
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:48,060
My chest hurts.

900
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:51,060
Do you like me?

901
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,060
I like you.

902
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,060
But I can't.

903
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:59,060
Are you okay?

904
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:00,060
I'm fine.

905
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,060
Does it hurt?

906
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:13,060
If I touch you, I'll get a bruise.

907
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,060
Are you okay?

908
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:18,060
I don't know if anyone is listening.

909
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,060
Look at me.

910
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:30,060
I can't touch you.

911
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,060
I don't want to touch you.

912
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:38,060
I can't touch you.

913
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:45,060
I can't touch you.

914
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:52,060
I can't touch you.

915
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,060
Wait a minute.

916
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:03,060
Why are you doing this?

917
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:07,060
I have to do this.

918
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,060
The president is here.

919
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:15,060
What's wrong?

920
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:17,060
I can't do this.

921
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:20,060
Wait a minute.

922
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:22,060
I can't do this.

923
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:28,060
Please forgive me.

924
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,060
It's okay.

925
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:33,060
I can't do this.

926
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,060
I can't do this.

927
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:51,060
Wait a minute.

928
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:53,060
I can't do this.

929
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:56,060
It's okay.

930
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,060
I can't do this.

931
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:09,060
I can't do this.

932
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,060
Why?

933
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,060
I can't do this.

934
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:32,060
I can't do this.

935
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:55,060
Let's stop this.

936
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:58,060
I can't do this.

937
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:03,060
I can't do this.

938
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,060
It's okay.

939
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,060
I can't do this.

940
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:52,060
I can't do this.

941
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:02,060
I can't do this.

942
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:13,060
I can't do this.

943
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:28,060
I can't do this.

944
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,060
I can't do this.

945
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,060
I can't do this.

946
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,060
I can't do this.

947
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:32,060
I can't do this.

948
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:03,060
I can't do this.

949
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:05,060
I can't do this.

950
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,060
What do you want to do?

951
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:11,060
I have a lot of things.

952
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,060
What do you have?

953
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:32,060
I can't do this.

954
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,060
I can't do this.

955
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,060
I can't do this.

956
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:17,060
I can't do this.

957
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:32,060
I can't do this.

958
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,060
I can't do this.

959
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,060
I can't do this.

960
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:32,060
I can't do this.

961
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,060
I can't do this.

962
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:49,060
Do you like bamboo?

963
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:51,060
Yes.

964
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,060
I can't do this.

965
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:06,060
I can't do this.

966
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:18,060
I can't do this.

967
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,600
Come here.

968
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,040
Here.

969
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,380
Good girl.

970
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:26,520
It's time to go home for dinner.

971
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,500
Are you ready?

972
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,500
Stop it!

973
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,500
What happened to your elbow?

974
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,260
Where is the camera?

975
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:06,260
I don't have it.

976
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,880
See what?

977
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,960
OK, I got it.

978
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,960
Take your phone and put it in your bag.

979
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,960
My phone?

980
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,960
Yes.

981
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,960
Give me your bag.

982
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,960
Yes.

983
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,960
I'm going to the bathroom.

984
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,960
Yes.

985
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,960
I'm going to the bathroom.

986
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,960
Yes.

987
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,960
I'm going to the bathroom.

988
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,960
Yes.

989
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,960
Has it been 10 minutes?

990
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,960
I don't know.

991
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,960
Please don't tell the president.

992
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,960
This is a secret.

993
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,960
Yes.

994
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,960
Yes.

995
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,960
Are you tired?

996
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,960
No.

997
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,960
Is it because it's dark?

998
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,960
No.

999
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,960
Everyone was happy with the lunch box.

1000
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,960
Everyone was happy with the lunch box.

1001
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,960
I'm sorry.

1002
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,960
Can you make it again today?

1003
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,960
Yes.

1004
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,960
Come a little later.

1005
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,960
I want to feed the people who are working overtime.

1006
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,960
I want to feed the people who are working overtime.

1007
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,960
Okay.

1008
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,960
Can I really do it?

1009
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,960
You don't have a company, do you?

1010
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,960
You don't have a company, do you?

1011
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,960
Yes.

1012
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,960
I got a commission from the bank.

1013
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,960
I got a commission from the bank.

1014
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,960
I see.

1015
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,960
Why don't you make me your wife?

1016
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,960
Why don't you make me your wife?

1017
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,960
What?

1018
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,960
Do you feel better?

1019
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,960
What?

1020
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,960
Tell me clearly.

1021
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,960
Tell me clearly.

1022
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,960
I was very tired and went home.

1023
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,960
I was very tired and went home.

1024
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,960
When I got home,

1025
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,960
When I got home,

1026
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,960
the room was clean.

1027
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,960
The room was clean.

1028
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,960
What are you doing?

1029
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,960
The room was clean.

1030
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,960
There is aосh information on the table.

1031
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,960
There is aosh information on the table.

1032
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,960
You can leave it.

1033
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,960
I'm already working hard.

1034
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,960
I'm already working hard.

1035
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,960
There was a lot of family pranks.

1036
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,960
There was a lot of family pranks.

1037
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,960
I was furious at my wife.

1038
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,960
Why are you trying to be happy by yourself?

1039
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:40,960
She couldn't forgive me.

1040
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,960
So, do you want to get back at her?

1041
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:47,960
No.

1042
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,960
I just want to break her heart.

1043
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,960
You're crazy.

1044
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,960
I'm sorry.

1045
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,960
I'm so tired.

1046
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,960
I left my chocolate here.

1047
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:20,960
Oh, no.

1048
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,960
I'm sorry.

1049
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:22,960
Are you okay?

1050
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:23,960
No, I'm fine.

1051
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:25,960
Good evening.

1052
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,960
Hey, Reniki.

1053
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,960
Come on in.

1054
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:32,960
I thought you might be hungry.

1055
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:33,960
Really?

1056
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:35,960
Thank you.

1057
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,960
Thank you.

1058
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:39,960
Here you are.

1059
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,960
I'm so happy.

1060
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:44,960
I love you, Miki.

1061
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:45,960
Me, too.

1062
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,960
You mean the lunch box, right?

1063
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,960
No, I love you, Miki.

1064
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,960
Stop it.

1065
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:55,960
I love you.

1066
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,960
I love you, Miki.

1067
01:31:58,960 --> 01:31:59,960
I love you.

1068
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,960
Stop it.

1069
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:05,960
Stop it.

1070
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:09,960
By the way, did your wife say anything strange to you?

1071
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:10,960
My wife?

1072
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:12,960
I don't know.

1073
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,960
Did she?

1074
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:15,960
Which one?

1075
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:16,960
Which one?

1076
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:17,960
I don't know.

1077
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,960
Stop it.

1078
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:29,960
Stop it.

1079
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,960
Where are you touching?

1080
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,960
I'm scared.

1081
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,960
Please be quiet.

1082
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,960
Are you doing this?

1083
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:40,960
No, I'm not.

1084
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,960
I've always wanted to make you happy.

1085
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,960
I was happy when I saw you at the wedding.

1086
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,960
I'm glad to see you all.

1087
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:52,960
Stop it.

1088
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:54,960
Stop it.

1089
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:59,960
Stop it.

1090
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:02,960
Stop it.

1091
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,960
Don't touch me.

1092
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:11,960
Stop it.

1093
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:12,960
Don't move.

1094
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,960
Put your tongue out.

1095
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:17,960
Stop it.

1096
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:28,960
Stop it.

1097
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,960
You're disgusting.

1098
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:33,960
Stop it.

1099
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,960
Open your mouth.

1100
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,960
Put your tongue out.

1101
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:42,960
Disgusting.

1102
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:43,960
That's right.

1103
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:45,960
Give me a kiss.

1104
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,960
I'm glad to see you all.

1105
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:53,960
Stop it.

1106
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,960
You're dirty.

1107
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:00,960
Stop it.

1108
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:02,960
Stop it.

1109
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:15,960
Stop it.

1110
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:19,960
I'll show you.

1111
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,960
You're disgusting.

1112
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:27,960
I'll show you.

1113
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:31,960
You're the best.

1114
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,960
You're beautiful.

1115
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:35,960
You're getting a little chubby.

1116
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:37,960
I'm a little embarrassed.

1117
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:39,960
Wow,

1118
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,960
it's coming out soon.

1119
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:49,960
It's good

1120
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,960
.

1121
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:05,960
I've always wanted to see it.

1122
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,960
Look over here.

1123
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,960
No, please stop.

1124
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,960
I don't think he's licking it.

1125
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,960
It's not a manga.

1126
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,960
He's licking it.

1127
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,960
Keep going.

1128
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:39,960
I can't stand it.

1129
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,960
I can't stand it.

1130
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:45,960
I can't stand it.

1131
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:51,960
Wow, it's getting hot in here.

1132
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,960
His legs are open.

1133
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,960
It's hot.

1134
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,960
I can't stand it.

1135
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:01,960
I can't stand it.

1136
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:03,960
I can't stand it.

1137
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,960
I can't stand it.

1138
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,960
I can't stand it.

1139
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:09,960
I can't stand it.

1140
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:15,960
His butt is also open.

1141
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:17,960
How is it?

1142
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:19,960
It's really hot.

1143
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,960
I can't stand it.

1144
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:25,960
It's hot.

1145
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:27,960
Is that so?

1146
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,960
Is that so?

1147
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,960
Wow,

1148
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:33,960
it's hot.

1149
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,960
I don't like it.

1150
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,960
It's really beautiful.

1151
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,960
It's really beautiful.

1152
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:51,960
I'll put it here.

1153
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,960
Please let me go.

1154
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:57,960
Please let me go.

1155
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,960
Where do you want me to lick?

1156
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,960
Where do you want me to lick?

1157
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:19,960
He's crazy.

1158
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,960
He's crazy.

1159
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,960
He's crazy.

1160
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,960
He's crazy.

1161
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:29,960
The hair's also turned blue.

1162
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,960
The hair's also turned blue.

1163
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,960
The hair's also turned blue.

It smells good.

1172
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:57,960
Hey, are you stupid?

1173
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,960
Come on, get on this side

1174
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,960
Put your back on it

1175
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,960
You are great

1176
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,960
Hold your legs

1177
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:15,960
Good

1178
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:19,960
You are so wet

1179
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:23,960
Don't hide it

1180
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:25,960
Don't hide it

1181
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:27,960
You are so wet

1182
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:31,960
Are you excited?

1183
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,960
You are lying

1184
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,960
Tell me the truth

1185
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,960
Are you excited?

1186
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,960
A little bit

1187
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,960
You are the best

1188
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,960
Let's have fun

1189
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:47,960
Does it feel good?

1190
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,960
You can't touch the blanket

1191
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,960
You can't touch the blanket

1192
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,960
I want you to do this

1193
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,960

Come on

1196
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,960
One, two

1197
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,960
You are such a good boy

1198
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,960
You are such a good boy

1199
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:21,960

Open your mouth

1202

You are such a good boy

1203
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,960
Can I touch you?

1204
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,960
Good for you

1205
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:40,960
I didn't say I like you

1206
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:42,960
Can I touch you?

1207
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:50,960
You are such a good boy

1208
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,960
Can I touch you?

1209
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,960
You are such a good boy

1210
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,960
You are such a good boy

1211
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,960
Keep doing it

1212
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:08,960
You are such a good boy

1213
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,960
You are such a good boy

1214
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,960
Do you want to show me?

1215
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,960
Show me

1216
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,960
Show me

1217
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:38,960
You are such a good boy

1218
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,960
You are such a good boy

1219
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,960
You should tell me when you are going

1220
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:51,960
You are such a good boy

1221
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,960
You are such a good boy

1222
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,960
I brought something interesting

1223
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,960
What is it?

1224
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,960
You put it in your bag?

1225
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,960
You put it in your bag?

1226
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,960
You put it in your bag?

1227
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,960
You put it in your bag?

1228
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,960
You put it in your bag?

1229
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,960
What's wrong?

1230
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,960
You are not the first time, right?

1231
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:28,960
You are not the first time, right?

1232
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:35,960
Does it feels good?

1233
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,960
It feels great, right?

1234
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:46,960
It feels great, right?

1235
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:51,960
It feels great

1236
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:57,960
Come on, come on

1237
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:01,960
Come on, come on

1238
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,960
You are such a good boy.

1239
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:07,960
Look at this side, too.

1240
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,960
You are such a good boy.

1241
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:17,960
You are such a good boy.

1242
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:29,960
You are such a good boy.

1243
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,960
I will put it on your belly.

1244
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:35,960
Do you want me to put it on your belly?

1245
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,960
Please.

1246
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,960

You are such a good boy.

1250
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:59,960
You are such a good boy.

1251
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:01,960
Do you feel good?

1252
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:03,960
Do you feel good, Miki-san?

1253
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,960
Both of them.

1254
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,960
Both of them?

1255
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,960
Do you think I will go crazy if I have both of them?

1256
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,960
Please say it clearly.

1257
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,960
I will go crazy if I have both of them.

1258
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,960
You are the best.

1259
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,960
Do you feel good?

1260
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,960
Are you going to go crazy?

1261
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,960
Please say it clearly.

1262
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,960
You are such a good boy.

1263
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:55,960
You fell down.

1264
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,960
Let's go to bed.

1265
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:59,960
Let's go to bed.

1266
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,960
Good boy.

1267
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:09,960
You seem to want something in your mouth.

1268
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,960
You want something in your mouth.

1269
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,960
No?

1270
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,960
No?

1271
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,960
You want something in your mouth.

1272
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,960
You feel good, don't you?

1273
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,960
You feel good, don't you?

1274
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,960
You are such a good boy.

1275
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,960
You are such a good boy.

1276
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,960
You are such a good boy.

1277
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,960
That's why I think you are cute.

1278
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:10,960
Do you think it's okay for me to do this?

1279
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:12,960
You can't be satisfied with this.

1280
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,960
You feel good, don't you?

1281
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,960
What are you talking about?

1282
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,960
But...

1283
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,960
What will happen if you put this in your mouth?

1284
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,960
You can't say such a thing.

1285
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:24,960
You can open your mouth by yourself.

1286
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,960
Okay.

1287
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:30,960
You put it in your mouth.

1288
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,960
You put it in your mouth.

1289
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,960
You put it in your mouth.

1290
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,960
When you put it in your mouth, show it to me.

1291
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,960
When you put it in your mouth, show it to me.

1292
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,960
It's good.

1293
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,960
You feel good.

1294
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,960
You can see it, right?

1295
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,960
You have to say it feels good

1296
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,960
It feels good

1297
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,960
Let's move this

1298
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:04,960
How is it?

1299
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,960
Does it feel good?

1300
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,960
Wow, you are full of energy

1301
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,960

1303
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:16,960
I'm glad you are full of energy

1304
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,960
You are full of energy

1305
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:20,960
You are full of energy

1306
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,960
You remember it feels good, right?

1307
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,960
You remember it feels good, right?

1308
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:54,960
Yeah, I do

1309
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,960
Yeah, I do

1310
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,960
You can do it

1311
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,960
You can do it

1312
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,960
Hold it

1313
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,960
Hold it, Chiku

1314
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:21,300

1315
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:24,580
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1316
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:28,840
You should let out all the blood!

1317
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:30,220
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1318
01:47:30,220 --> 01:47:33,480
Greeeeat!

1319
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:37,680

01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:41,560
Still going toferthe sacrifice of son.

1321

We're all gonna be one body and I'm gonna make it secondary for you.

1322
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:48,020
You are a good boy.

1323
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:56,020
He is going to sleep.

1324
01:47:56,020 --> 01:47:58,020
Open your mouth.

1325
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:10,020
Do you want me to wipe your face?

1326
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:12,020
Good boy.

1327
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:18,020
You are a good boy.

1328
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:20,020
You are a good boy.

1329
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:30,020
Do you want me to wipe your face?

1330
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:32,020

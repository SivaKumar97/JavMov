1
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,500
Are you nervous, you are nervous?

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,580
Is it okay?

3
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,120
So I could ride the new car alone.

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,100
It was far away, right?

5
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,680
Okay okay okay.

6
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,380
You really look like face.

7
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,730
But the character seems to be the opposite.

8
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,710
Yes to?

9
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,870
Is your dad and mom well?

10
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,110
You are fine, you are always together.

11
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:02,250
Yes, so I have to take the cane home.

12
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,250
I am nervous, am I okay?

13
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,651
It is okay, you guys.

14
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:11,151
Oh is?

15
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,610
Yes

16
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,530
What is it? – Uncertain answer.

17
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,350
Is it okay?

18
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,111
It is OK.

19
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:22,611
really is?

20
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,771
Yes

21
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:27,131
by

22
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:29,471
I want to take you to tourism.

23
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:32,530
I was in a sudden journey.

24
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,370
I am going to get into work suddenly.

25
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,811
No other way.

26
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:43,131
Because it is an important time.

27
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:44,551
Instead of that.

28
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:49,250
You will be cooking meals, so don’t worry.

29
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,450
Does it fit in your mouth?

30
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,811
It is OK.

31
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:58,490
What is the appropriate answer.

32
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,930
Because it is irresponsible.

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,481
So I will go.

34
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:35,721
Use the key for me.

35
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:39,220
Enjoy Tokyo tourism.

36
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,641
I think I can go home today at about 18 o’clock.

37
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:46,220
Then I will cook.

38
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,940
Thanks to.

39
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,220
Close the key properly.

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,480
And again at night.

41
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,970
Go home

42
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,871
Sorry, I was on the wrong train.

43
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:45,331
And it is entirely.

44
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:46,411
I have lost.

45
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:49,211
I have already drank too.

46
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:51,910
Sorry for the easy meal.

47
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,190
Eat it if you want.

48
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,950
Thanks to.

49
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,300
Please go

50
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,621
No to

51
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:18,100
How did Yuki feel before?

52
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,660
Always be kind to me.

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,660
Even the student president.

54
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,480
He was a very cool brother.

55
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,660
Nothing has changed now, absolutely.

56
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,781
I just don’t like insects.

57
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:45,520
When the cockroaches came out.

58
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,140
Instead, I protected my brother.

59
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,340
I did not know.

60
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:59,320
I have never had a cane yet, it’s surprising.

61
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,310
Did you have an euthanasia?

62
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:19,571
Yes, great.I got a lot of chocolate for Valentine, so I shared it with you.

63
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:24,671
It is better, then.

64
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:27,170
You had a grandfather too.

65
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:41,310
The same face, but now she is.

66
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,120
Not always there.

67
00:06:51,660 --> 00:07:01,980
Sorry, I don’t think you should worry about that.

68
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,580
Maybe one day the destiny will appear.

69
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,391
by Mr.

70
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:32,230
Will I try to kiss?

71
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,700
Oh is?

72
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,940
To have confidence.

73
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,660
I will teach you.

74
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,020
How is?

75
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,130
is soft?

76
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,200
I am very nervous.

77
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:15,701
Strengthen and open your mouth.

78
00:09:15,701 --> 00:10:00,321
Look at it all the time.

79
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:01,821
Yes to yes.

80
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,630
I will let you know easily.

81
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,720
Keep it out.

82
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,510
The feelings of Peru.

83
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,190
Yes, this is

84
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,451
Same as cuddling.

85
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,551
It is soft.

86
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,250
It feels good.

87
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,840
Put out your mouth.

88
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,970
It is different than before.

89
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,870
I feel more and more.

90
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:58,510
Down in the mouth.

91
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
Smoking lightly

92
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:23,120
It feels good, right?

93
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,111
So this time.

94
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:53,630
by  by  by  by

95
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,300
As I did.

96
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,080
First lightly

97
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,180
What did you do next?

98
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,860
Perry

99
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,681
The Pearl of.

100
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:05,280
Absolutely get involved.

101
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,041
greatly

102
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,380
I ate

103
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,980
It is sweat.

104
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,971
Sorry to

105
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:37,030
Did you paint too much?

106
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,310
well

107
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,810
So let’s go in the bath.

108
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:57,770
His face changed.

109
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,761
and

110
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:26,320
Can I get water?

111
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,061
Yes

112
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:38,140
I think it’s in the refrigerator.

113
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,810
No to?

114
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,841
Oh well.

115
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:54,761
Oh well.

116
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:56,880
Did not come in?

117
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,120
There is water, right?

118
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,910
Mr Yee

119
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,370
What are you doing?

120
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,730
Sorry to

121
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,710
Sorry to

122
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,250
Do not tell your brother.

123
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,990
You wanted to kiss.

124
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:18,270
Do not tell later.

125
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,030
Come here.

126
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,910
Sorry to

127
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,310
Not to apologize.

128
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,211
Every boy will be like this.

129
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:26,310
From a girl.

130
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,310
I am glad.

131
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,760
Close the eyes.

132
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,620
Yes is

133
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,080
Are you close eyes?

134
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,900
Yes is

135
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,440
not opened it.

136
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,290
Keep looking at it.

137
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,410
Are you closing your eyes?

138
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,391
Yes is

139
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:01,070
It is closed.

140
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,260
Are you close eyes?

141
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,280
Have you not seen?

142
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,320
I have never watched.

143
00:32:37,490 --> 00:34:09,450
Oh well, it is great,

144
00:34:20,320 --> 00:35:08,530
Oh oh oh oh

145
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:58,901
Oh oh oh oh

146
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:00,401
Oh oh oh oh

147
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,150
In the meal,

148
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,610
Do not tell me.

149
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,650
Yes is

150
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:27,910
You can open your eyes.

151
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:19,561
Good morning.

152
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:22,381
Good morning, I am at work.

153
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:25,000
I put it in the dining room so eat it.

154
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,841
When you go out, keep the lock.

155
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:28,281
Yes is

156
00:38:28,281 --> 00:38:29,640
I will go.

157
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,880
Come to go.

158
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,171
Do not feel.

159
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,091
Go home to.

160
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,350
I drank too much.

161
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,490
I was drunk.

162
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:11,070
Didn’t you go out too?

163
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,370
Have you been home all the time?

164
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,290
Yes is

165
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:19,250
Tell me, I bought food.

166
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,710
Make something easy.

167
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,810
Oh, I was surprised.

168
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,231
A little

169
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:58,490
yet another time.

170
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,961
How is it.

171
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:07,680
What, what happened

172
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:27,950
I cannot stop.

173
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,150
What is?

174
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:36,400
If you look at the princess’s body, it won’t stop.

175
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,720
Please, just one more time.

176
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,260
What is?

177
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,440
Close my eyes.

178
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,560
What you did, please.

179
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,250
I want to do.

180
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,890
Yes to.

181
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:17,030
I thought about it all day today.

182
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,870
I am not thinking about that.

183
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:25,450
That is why I couldn’t go out.

184
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,450
No problem though.

185
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,870
Just close your eyes.

186
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,211
Yes is

187
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:44,350
I imagined it today.

188
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,740
He is home already.

189
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:10,990
It just feels good about this.

190
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,960
Move a little.

191
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,641
You want more.

192
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:38,160
Yes please please.

193
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,950
well this

194
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,930
The outer skin.

195
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:23,931
Just go for this.

196
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:25,431
Feel good

197
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,950
You wanted to do this, right?

198
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,960
It’s different than doing it yourself, right?

199
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,261
I want to make you a knight.

200
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:10,520
Take more responsibility.

201
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,640
Is my hand good?

202
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,120
I also like the hand of the man.

203
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,920
I want you to speak.

204
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,470
What to do.

205
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:35,010
Please please.

206
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:41,011
Do not open your eyes.

207
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,470
But it seems to be just hands.

208
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,400
I will endure.

209
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,620
I’ll go down again.

210
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,100
If you can be patient, I will give you.

211
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,430
Oh, it is damn.

212
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,000
You have endured.

213
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,900
The great great

214
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:33,670

215
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:50,270
I am very patient.

216
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:24,450
You are weak here.

217
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:49,680
It feels good.

218
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,680
I am in a hurry, this.

219
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,560
I have endured a lot, so I will add.

220
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:11,410
greatly

221
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,310
greatly

222
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,160
I have endured it all the time.

223
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,760
It feels good.

224
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:31,620
Okay, if you want to go, go right.

225
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,080
It is better to have a lot of patience.

226
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,700
Eat a lot.

227
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,720
I am getting stupid sometimes.

228
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,720
It is hot.

229
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:54,581
I like the shade.

230
00:50:54,581 --> 00:50:56,460

231
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,020

I will not stop.

236
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,530
The chicken became red.

237
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,051
Whatever it feels good.

238
00:52:13,051 --> 00:52:14,551
Feel good

239
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:52,390
It is pan.

240
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,201
Oh, it will go out.

241
00:53:20,201 --> 00:53:28,701
I will go out.

242
00:53:28,701 --> 00:53:31,761
When is it here?

243
00:53:31,761 --> 00:53:35,160
Okay, let it out.

244
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:45,610
I want to have sex with you.

245
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:51,011
No to sex.

246
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:52,170
Please please.

247
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,830
to your brother.

248
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,610
I will definitely disclose it.

249
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,110
Eyes

250
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:03,870
I will not open.

251
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,420
with your eyes.

252
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:15,070
Sex is

253
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,410
I want to.

254
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,161
Look like you cry.

255
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:33,750
Can you close your eyes properly?

256
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:36,730
What to do?

257
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:38,630
Can I keep secret?

258
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:43,170
Definitely not there.

259
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:49,630
So, sleep there.

260
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,320
Wait a little.

261
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,640
Never open your eyes.

262
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:27,750
The promise?

263
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,930
Because you shouldn’t see it.

264
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:07,560
Oh well fuck.

265
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:13,890
I got fucked here.

266
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,960
Great is

267
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,440
Is your first sex good?

268
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:51,780
I didn’t think it felt nice.

269
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,201
Feel good

270
00:57:54,201 --> 00:58:04,420
I will go away soon, so I will move slowly.

271
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:53,000
very hardly

272
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:40,050
I am so dumb.

1
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,640
Still be patient.

2
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,480
It is my first sex.

3
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,660
Yes to.

4
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,820
I want to have more fun.

5
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:46,080
Oh, that is a mess.

6
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,120
It feels good anyway.

7
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,590
Have you not opened your eyes?

8
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:24,051
not opened it.

9
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:27,530

Are you not watching?

14
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:10,020
Close your eyes.

15
01:02:27,390 --> 01:03:24,960
I cannot get up.

16
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:14,870
This is shit.

01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:10,140
I want to go.

19
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:25,490
You can do it well and you want to enjoy it again.

20
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,350
I am working hard.

21

01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,561
A lot of stuff.

113
01:32:40,561 --> 01:32:43,060
Oh well Mr Yume.

114
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:47,720
They cleaned and cut.

115
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:51,040
I do not know.

116
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:54,060
Maybe because Yumi was in.

117
01:32:58,140 --> 01:32:58,920
Oh is?

118
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:00,541
Now we buried it.

119
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:02,860
Just a little, Mr. Yume.

120
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:05,000
A little

121
01:33:20,000 --> 01:34:27,560
Oh yeah yeah

Oh,

What are you doing?

124
01:35:17,290 --> 01:35:17,391
Oh yeah

125
01:35:17,391 --> 01:35:19,430
Because Mr. Zhao was asleep.

126
01:35:19,570 --> 01:35:21,750
Have you been a little?

127
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:24,270
cute and strong.

128
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:27,851
No longer touched.

129
01:35:27,851 --> 01:35:29,710

01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,441
Tomatoes

137
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:04,740
How many tomatoes do you eat?

138
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:07,901
About 5 is?

139

About five?

140
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:12,820
Three, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight.

01:37:28,311 --> 01:37:30,630
Not eating much, usually.

147
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:32,190
Eat a lot.

Because I feel too bad.

183
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:46,480
Are you sleeping in my bedroom today?

184
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:49,570
Okay is it?

185

Oh yeah I understand.

Come back again.

203
01:42:52,211 --> 01:43:28,731
Come back again.

204
01:43:28,731 --> 01:43:30,470
No longer can.

205
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:51,650
I can’t do it anymore, it’s so fun.

206

I can’t do it anymore, it’s so fun.

Oh yeah yeah yeah

02:00:04,610 --> 02:00:06,430
The old feeling.

2
02:00:06,430 --> 02:00:09,210
It feels good.

3
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:44,101

Tagged as  Mumbai

7
02:02:20,750 --> 02:02:25,970
I want to shoot more and more with the last shot.

8
02:02:26,330 --> 02:02:29,610
Try to get more ginger.

9
02:02:44,610 --> 02:02:47,110
It feels good now.

10
02:02:47,110 --> 02:02:50,550
It becomes more and more hard.

11
02:03:02,970 --> 02:03:05,551
Pin is bad.

12
02:03:05,551 --> 02:03:10,750
by Mr.

13
02:03:10,970 --> 02:03:12,431
I entered and brought out.

14
02:03:12,431 --> 02:03:14,670
Is it inside?

15
02:03:15,530 --> 02:03:16,330
Have you come?

16
02:03:16,330 --> 02:03:16,891

02:03:16,891 --> 02:03:57,660
I just got out.

02:03:58,220 --> 02:04:02,220
How many times can I photograph you?

19
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:07,480
Let me really go.

02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:31,780
My sister, I love you.

24
02:04:48,930 --> 02:04:51,410
I don’t want you to go to your sister.

25
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:14,720
Feel badly

26

Oh yeah

39
02:07:56,261 --> 02:07:57,081
Wait a little.

40
02:07:57,081 --> 02:08:03,930
It hurts...

41
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:54,260
It hurts...

42
02:09:01,820 --> 02:09:02,881
Once again...

43
02:09:02,881 --> 02:09:10,960
Once again, once more, once more...

44
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:41,340
Oh, awesome...

Fuck me, shake me.

More to hiccups.

54
02:11:00,620 --> 02:11:36,660
Go to more.

55
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:39,600
Gentlemen are

56
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:48,001

Oh yeah yeah yeah

64
02:13:09,470 --> 02:13:12,771
Oh, oh, what I like most is the cuts.

65
02:13:12,771 --> 02:13:14,950
Hold this up.

66
02:13:16,450 --> 02:13:22,090
I think you like the ladder, you like the ladder.

67
02:13:23,310 --> 02:13:25,790
It feels good, this.

68
02:13:51,560 --> 02:14:01,960
Go to go, go to go.

69
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:12,320
A lot of insects don’t come out.

70
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:13,880
Of course I want to grind.

72
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:20,360

Oh yeah yeah yeah

76
02:14:51,431 --> 02:14:53,750
You can more.

77
02:15:06,230 --> 02:15:09,510
Too much already.

78
02:15:15,530 --> 02:15:17,850
Keep the sound full.

79
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:26,441
You feel too good.

80
02:15:26,441 --> 02:15:28,720
Oh well fuck.

81
02:15:43,470 --> 02:15:45,730
I can no longer endure.

82
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:41,200
Yes

83
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:47,501
You went out again.

84
02:16:47,501 --> 02:16:50,200
I went out.

85
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:58,561
I am happy with Yumi.

86
02:16:58,561 --> 02:17:00,061
No to?

87
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:02,280
More tired.

88
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:04,580
Are you no longer satisfied?

89
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:06,620
still is

90
02:17:07,440 --> 02:17:12,180
I want to be with the princess until the end.

91
02:17:27,130 --> 02:17:28,930
Not to do.

92
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:32,690
This is truly the last.

93
02:17:36,130 --> 02:17:41,130
True, I think you can still do it.

94
02:18:07,970 --> 02:18:35,480
That feels good too.

95
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:40,480
I will get involved in the swing.

96
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:49,840
Try to push the man more.

97
02:19:09,050 --> 02:19:12,990
I really love you for the swing.

98
02:19:13,870 --> 02:19:15,370
Why Why?

99
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:39,640
What are you doing?

100
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:18,980
Continue to breathe.

101
02:21:02,950 --> 02:21:06,070
See well.

102
02:21:06,070 --> 02:21:11,030
I will connect with the splash and look at it.

103
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:02,680
I no longer try hard.

104
02:22:04,820 --> 02:22:07,160
Make it more sensitive.

105
02:22:13,660 --> 02:22:15,210
This is FU.

106
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:51,521
Her hair is mosquito.

107
02:23:51,521 --> 02:23:53,180
Healed something?

108
02:23:53,660 --> 02:23:55,550
Yumi was very tough.

109
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:57,721
It is Sivas.

110
02:23:57,721 --> 02:23:59,221
Welcome to.

111
02:23:59,221 --> 02:24:02,600
Welcome to

112
02:24:03,100 --> 02:24:04,600
Are you tired?

113
02:24:04,620 --> 02:24:06,761
I wanted to go to Tokyo tourism.

114
02:24:06,761 --> 02:24:08,221
I got home a little earlier.

115
02:24:08,221 --> 02:24:09,721
Oh yeah yeah.

116
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:12,980
Do you want to go somewhere?

117
02:24:12,980 --> 02:24:15,060
Cousin to go.

118
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:17,660
Yes is.

119
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:19,541
There are many places I want to go.

120
02:24:19,541 --> 02:24:20,561
I do not know.

121
02:24:20,561 --> 02:24:21,640
So what that?

122
02:24:21,640 --> 02:24:23,161
Maybe I go on ice.

123
02:24:23,161 --> 02:24:25,321
The ice is hot.

124
02:24:25,321 --> 02:24:26,820
Okay is not?

125
02:24:26,820 --> 02:24:27,620
Going from now?

126
02:24:27,620 --> 02:24:28,680
Are you tired?

127
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:29,481
Okay is ok.

128
02:24:29,481 --> 02:24:30,481
Maybe you want to go.

129
02:24:30,481 --> 02:24:31,981
Let us go.
